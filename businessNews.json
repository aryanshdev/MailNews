press release that it was adding a new burger — which it described as having “twice the beef of a Big Mac and flavors fast food lovers will recognize” — to its ‘3 for me’ value menu.In response, Chili’s decided to run ads that “use fast food as a foil,” he said.Chili’s also ran video ads comparing its food favorably to fast food burgers."},"\n      Why tonight’s massive solar storm could

long as the underlying electrical infrastructure that supports wireless networks remains unaffected, even an extreme space weather event should result in “minimal direct impact to public safety line of-sight radio and commercial cellular services … and no first-order impact to consumer electronic devices,” according to researchers summarizing the findings of a 2010 study of extreme space weather conducted by NOAA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.NOAA’s warning of extreme space weather suggests the storm could trigger numerous effects for life on earth, possibly affecting the power grid as well as satellite and high frequency radio communications.“Geomagnetic storms can impact infrastructure in near-Earth orbit and on Earth’s surface, potentially disrupting communications, the electric power grid, navigation, radio and satellite operations,” NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said in a release.Severe space weather can jeopardize power grids, according to NOAA, whose alert this week said to expect “possible widespread voltage control problems” and that “some protective systems may mistakenly trip out key assets from the power grid.As if to underscore that point, the US government’s advice to the public on how to prepare for a space weather event largely resembles the same steps you’d take in response to an extended power outage."},"\n      Jim Simons,

department.Born in Newton, Massachusetts, in 1938, Simons earned a mathematics degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a doctorate in math from the University of California, Berkeley.But Stony Brook also gave me a chance to lead — and so it has been deeply rewarding to watch the university grow and flourish even more."},"\n      Protesters attempt to storm Tesla’s factory

many as 800 activists gathered outside Tesla’s factory near Berlin Friday to protest its expansion plans, and some of them clashed with police as they attempted to break into the plant.Police officials said in a press release Friday that, “people from the previous protest march ran through the forest towards the Tesla company premises.Tesla shut the factory Friday to all employees in anticipation of crowds gathering outside in protest against the planned expansion.In early March, Tesla was also forced to close the plant, that time for a week, after a high-voltage electricity pylon delivering power to the factory was set on fire.Neither Tesla (TSLA) nor police in the German state of Brandenburg, where the plant is located, have responded to a CNN request for comment."},"\n

Michigan survey, as well as the most recent Conference Board survey on consumers’ attitudes toward the economy, underpin heightened uncertainty about the latter half of this year, Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, said in a Friday note.Even though inflation is lower compared to a year ago, it’s been moving in the wrong direction recently, shifting expectations for a rate cut from the Federal Reserve to the back burner.Additionally, consumers are bracing for even higher price increases in the year ahead compared to readings from prior months, the survey found.Consumers are gearing up for even bigger increases compared to the expected rise in mortgage rates over the next year, the survey found.Many Americans were likely surprised by higher tax bills this year after big gains in the stock market in 2023 and higher interest income from bank deposits and bonds last year,” Adams said in a note Friday."},"\n      Target is dialing back on Pride merchandise after right-wing

is limiting the number of stores that will sell LGBTQ-themed merchandise for Pride Month in June following a boycott from right-wing activists last year that took a toll on the brand’s bottom line.This year, Target said it will sell only Pride-themed “adult apparel” and home goods “in select stores, based on historical sales performance” — a drastic reversal for the chain that had typically sold the items in many of its US stores for the past decade.Last year, Target pulled Pride merchandise from some stores after the company and its employees became the focus of a “volatile” anti-LGBTQ campaign, which included threats against its store workers.A Target executive said on the earnings call that there was a “strong reaction” to Pride merchandise and the reaction was a “signal for us to pause, adapt and learn.That, plus the soft demand for discretionary goods, caused Target’s quarterly sales to fall for the first time in six years during the quarter that encompassed Pride assortment sales."}}

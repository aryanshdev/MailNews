throwing the ethical integrity of the outlet’s new publisher, Will Lewis, into serious question.Staffers at The Post are losing their patience with Bezos, whose only action thus far responding to the Lewis calamity has been to fire off a paltry, 138-word, single-paragraph memo from his Mediterranean yachting vacation to a handful of leaders at The Post, assuring them that he wants standards to remain “very high.“Will Lewis needs to step down for the good of The Post and the public,” wrote Higham on Facebook.Meanwhile, it is likely that many more questions will be raised in the future as The Post and outlets such as The New York Times continue to take a hard look at Lewis’ history.In conversations with more than a dozen people inside and close to The Post this week, it’s been made clear that Lewis, in his brief six months on the job, has totally alienated staff and now faces insurmountable odds to win back the employee base he seeks to lead."}}

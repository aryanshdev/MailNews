           <p >Other researchers have found similar biases across the board: text-to-image generative AI models often produce images that include biased and stereotypical traits related to gender, skin colour, occupations, nationalities and more.In response to Nature’s questions about which measures are in place to remove harmful or biased content from DALL·E’s training data set, OpenAI pointed to publicly available reports that outline its work to reduce gender and racial bias, without providing exact details on how that’s accomplished.In a 2023 study, Birhane and her team compared the data set LAION-400M, which has 400 million image links, with LAION-2B-en, which has 2 billion, and found that hate content in the captions increased by around 12% in the larger data set10, probably because more low-quality data had slipped through.After some digging, Kalluri and her colleagues found that images generated by the popular tools Stable Diffusion, released by the firm Stability AI, and DALL·E, from OpenAI, overwhelmingly resorted to common stereotypes, such as associating the word ‘Africa’ with poverty, or ‘poor’ with dark skin tones.This is a problem that is unique to image generation — by contrast, an AI text generator could create a language-based description of a doctor without ever mentioning gender or race, for instance; and for a language translator, the input text would be sufficient.</p>

           <p >In a 2022 legal briefing regarding staff-to-student sexual misconduct in England — with a focus on regulatory compliance in Wales and England, not in Scotland or Northern Ireland — law firm Eversheds Sutherland found that it would be legal for a prospective employer to ask an institutional referee whether an applicant had any live warnings or misconduct findings on file when they left the institution, or whether they were being investigated at the time.Another 2018 review, which examined more than 300 cases of faculty–student sexual harassment in the United States, found that more than half of perpetrators were serial harassers, and perpetrators often relocated to different institutions and repeated the same pattern of misconduct.Credit: Pawel Libera/LightRocket via GettyBecause most universities keep the findings of misconduct investigations confidential, sexual-harassment perpetrators are often able to move to other institutions without having to disclose why they left their old jobs.“Action such as subscription to the Misconduct Disclosure Scheme is for individual universities and colleges to decide on,” says David Smy, the office’s deputy director for enabling regulation.Under the scheme, a hiring organization can ask previous employers whether a person has been found to have committed misconduct, following an investigation; what the sanctions were; and whether the individual is part of any ongoing investigations, Bezzolato says.</p>

           <p >Bertrandt says in the complaint filed in Michigan Eastern District Court that it entered into a “design and development agreement” with Fisker in May 2022 to perform “engineering, design, and development services” on the Pear — a contract worth north of $35 million, according to a copy of the design and development agreement attached to the lawsuit.In the weeks that followed, Fisker stopped paying the engineering firm that helped develop those vehicles, according to a previously unreported lawsuit filed in federal court this week.Days before Bertrandt sued in federal court, Robert Lee, an employee who worked for Fisker from October 2023 to March 5, 2024, filed a proposed class action complaint in Los Angeles Superior Court alleging a pattern of overworking employees and not properly compensating them.Breaching the contract, according to Bertrandt, has cost the engineering firm an additional $5,858,000 in “lost profits, delay costs, and incidental damages,” which is why it’s seeking $12,919,443 in total damages.The engineering firm also claims that Fisker’s decision to put the development work on the Pear and Alaska EVs on “pause” is an additional breach of the contract as it caused Bertrandt to suffer delay costs.</p>

           <p >Bertrandt says in the complaint filed in Michigan Eastern District Court that it entered into a “design and development agreement” with Fisker in May 2022 to perform “engineering, design, and development services” on the Pear — a contract worth north of $35 million, according to a copy of the design and development agreement attached to the lawsuit.In the weeks that followed, Fisker stopped paying the engineering firm that helped develop those vehicles, according to a previously unreported lawsuit filed in federal court this week.Days before Bertrandt sued in federal court, Robert Lee, an employee who worked for Fisker from October 2023 to March 5, 2024, filed a proposed class action complaint in Los Angeles Superior Court alleging a pattern of overworking employees and not properly compensating them.Breaching the contract, according to Bertrandt, has cost the engineering firm an additional $5,858,000 in “lost profits, delay costs, and incidental damages,” which is why it’s seeking $12,919,443 in total damages.The engineering firm also claims that Fisker’s decision to put the development work on the Pear and Alaska EVs on “pause” is an additional breach of the contract as it caused Bertrandt to suffer delay costs.</p>

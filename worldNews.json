high court in Namibia declared two colonial-era laws that criminalised same-sex acts between men unconstitutional on Friday, in a landmark win for the LGBTQ community in the southern African country.Namibia inherited the laws when it gained independence from South Africa in 1990, though same-sex acts between men were initially criminalised under colonial rule.South Africa has since decriminalised same-sex sexual activity and is the only country on the African continent to allow LGBTQ couples to adopt children, marry and enter civil unions.Rights campaigners say that, while convictions under the laws on \"sodomy\" and \"unnatural sexual offences\" were relatively rare in Namibia, they have perpetuated discrimination against the LGBTQ community and made gay men live in fear of arrest.Consensual same-sex activity is prohibited in more than half of 54 African countries, according to ILGA, an international organisation supporting LGBTQ rights."}," Meet Suborno Bari,

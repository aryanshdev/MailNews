latest study demonstrated that the new vaccine raises a broad immune response, even in mice that were pre-immunised with SARS-CoV-2.The study by the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK and

and several that are currently circulating in bats and have potential to jump to humans and cause a pandemic.By training the immune system to attack these regions, it gives protection against other coronaviruses not represented in the vaccine, including ones that haven't even been identified yet.For example, the new vaccine does not include the SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus, which caused the 2003 SARS outbreak, yet it still induces an immune response to that virus."}," Columbia University Cancels Main Graduation Ceremony Over Gaza Protests

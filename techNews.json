team.Depop said that sellers who reached out to the support team should have received a response by today, and that the company will proactively notify its high volume sellers.Several other sellers have reported similar issues on the r/Depop subreddit, X, Facebook and Instagram: Payout dates are repeatedly getting pushed back one day at a time with no explanation.At first, the Depop app said that they would be paid on a Wednesday; each day, the app pushed back the payout date by another day, and several attempts to contact Depop’s support team yielded no results."},"Waymo to launch

companion":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sima-instructions.jpg?w=605","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/13/google-deepmind-trains-a-video-game-playing-ai-to-be-your-co-op-companion/","content":"“Traditional simulator-based agent training uses reinforcement learning for training, which requires the game or environment to provide a ‘reward’ signal for the agent to learn from – for example win/loss in the case of Go or Starcraft, or ‘score’ for Atari,” Harley told TechCrunch, and noted that this approach was used for those games and produced phenomenal results.AI models that play games go back decades, but they generally specialize in one game and always play to win.There are of course “AI” or computer characters that can do this kind of thing, but they’re more like features of a game: NPCs that you can use formal in-game commands to indirectly control.The researchers’ ambition, on top of advancing the ball in agent-based AI fundamentally, is to create a more natural game-playing companion than the stiff, hard-coded ones we have today.Deepmind’s SIMA (scalable instructable multiworld agent) doesn’t have any kind of access to the game’s internal code or rules; instead, it was trained on many, many hours of video showing gameplay by humans."},"TikTok ban: What’s going on with the proposed bill in

Congress not to ban itIn spite of TikTok’s decision to rile up its users — or perhaps because of it — the bill to force ByteDance to sell TikTok passed through the House Energy and Commerce Committee with a 50-0 vote on Thursday.On Wednesday morning, the House of Representatives will debate the newest bill to ban TikTok, which passed unanimously out of its committee last week.“Let me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country,” TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said last year during a separate hearing with the House Energy and Commerce Committee.After a surprise flurry of activity in the House, TikTok is the target of a new government push to separate the company from its Chinese ownership or force it out of the country.Now that the fast-tracked bill is out of committee, it is expected to have a full vote in the House in the upcoming week."},"Furno bets that super-efficient, modular kilns will turn the cement industry upside down":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/furno-kiln-prototype.jpg?w=564","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/13/furno-seed-round/","content":"Many developing countries aren’t able to finance a new plant or entice a company to build one, so they end up importing cement, paying dearly in the process.Furno’s answer has been to develop a cement kiln that’s smaller, more efficient, and more flexible than the massive ones favored by industry today.There are other steps that occur at a modern cement plant, but that’s the most important one.What’s more, because the flame front inside the kiln can be more precisely controlled, the company has a path toward using recycled cement from old concrete, Nagra said.A study of one in China showed that only about 30% of the heat in the kiln powered the calcination reaction; the rest was lost."},"Blockchain startup Sei Labs creates an interesting solution to make Ethereum

and Feng anticipates initial excitement for The Parallel Stack to come from existing Ethereum-focused applications that are hitting bandwidth issues and are looking for higher TPS options.It aims to improve the performance of transactions per second (TPS) of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based layer-2 blockchains through the tried-and-true computer science concept of parallel processing, TechCrunch learned exclusively.Aside from The Parallel Stack, Sei Labs has also been working on upgrading its blockchain to Sei V2, a parallelized EVM, which processes multiple transactions simultaneously and would make it accessible to a “global base of EVM developers,” according to a November 2023 blog post.But they use different design philosophies and Sei’s focus is on higher throughput through parallel processing, said Jeff Feng, Sei Labs co-founder, previously an investor at Coatue.The Parallel Stack can do around 5,000 TPS, but is aiming to hit 10,000 TPS by the end of the year, Jog said."},"Volley’s AI-enabled ball machine for racquet sports can simulate

traditional tennis ball machines that simply launch balls at varying speeds and heights, Volley’s trainer robot leverages AI and vision software to collect data as you play, learn your skill level, and simulate live gameplay– making it so you never need a full team to have a decent training session.However, Volley believes it doesn’t have an immediate competitor since it combines video recording and ball dispensing into one device, while also taking an AI-driven approach to simulate live play on the court.As an avid platform tennis player, John came up with the idea for Volley when he decided to put a tennis ball machine up on painter sticks to mimic certain shots.A new sports tech startup, Volley, aims to revolutionize the way racquet sports players (platform tennis, padel, and pickleball) train with its AI-enabled sports training machine.”Image Credits: VolleyAdditionally, Volley has three cameras built into the device for different purposes like person and ball tracking,

Act co-rapporteur, Dragoș Tudorache, gives a thumbs-up to the plenary vote result in European Parliament (Screengrab: Natasha Lomas/TechCrunch)The risk-based proposal was first presented by the European Commission back in April 2021.The lawmakers added that the AI Act represents the start of a journey for the EU’s governance of AI — stressing the model will need to evolve and be extended with additional legislation in the future, with Benifei pointing to the need for a directive to set rules for the use of AI in the workplace.The European Parliament voted Wednesday to adopt the AI Act, securing the bloc pole-position in setting rules for a broad sweep of artificial intelligence-powered software — or what regional lawmakers have dubbed “the world’s first comprehensive AI law”.“So there’s a whole new world out there that opens up where AI is going to play a central part and therefore, from this point onwards, as we’re also going to build the governance that comes out of the Act, we’ll have to be very mindful of this evolution of the technology in the future.Speaking during a debate Tuesday, ahead of the plenary vote, Dragoș Tudorache, MEP and co-rapporteur for the AI Act, said: “We have forever attached to the concept of artificial intelligence the fundamental values that form the basis of our societies."},"Spotify’s Audiobooks will get their own ‘Countdown

unspoken thing where fleet companies that do work in cities can no longer buy small trucks,” Jason Marks, Telo Truck’s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch.Marks said the new funding will help Telo develop deeper relationships with potential fleet customers and develop two “fully functional press vehicles” that will have the look, feel and fit and finish of the final product.But because those low-speed vehicles can’t be used on the highway, the fleet also has to buy and maintain a full-size pickup to be able to accomplish everything it needs to do.What some fleet managers have resorted to is buying neighborhood electric vehicles, which are basically souped-up golf carts that can be equipped with a small bed in the back.“We will still want to address the early users, and we want to intermingle that with delivering to bigger fleet customers at the same time.”"}}

suspension":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Worldcoin-Orb-with-World-ID-card.png?w=711","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/11/worldcoin-fails-to-get-injunction-against-spains-privacy-suspension/","content":"Controversial eyeball scanning startup Worldcoin has failed to get an injunction against a temporary suspension ordered Wednesday by Spain’s data protection authority, the AEPD.In its appeal against the AEPD’s order, Tools for Humanity had sought to argue the Spanish authority had overstepped by triggering the GDPR’s Article 66 “urgency procedure” — in light of an open investigation by the Bavarian data protection authority, its lead DPA under the GDPR’s mechanism for streamlining oversight of cross-border complaints.However the court found the AEPD’s suspension order to be justified on account of the risks around biometric data and how many individuals are being put at risk by Worldcoin’s processing, including children.The authority used emergency powers contained in the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to make the local order, which can apply for up to three months.Reached for comment on the dismissal of its appeal for an injunction, Tools for Humanity’s spokeswoman, Rebecca Hahn, emailed a statement she said is attributable to Worldcoin:Worldcoin is fully compliant with all laws and regulations governing biometric data collection and data transfer, including Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)."},"Bitcoin hits new all-time high of $72,700 but one index warns we’re in ‘extreme greed’

of the $10,000 in a pilot program to developers behind two popular SDKs, including the AT Protocol Python SDK (by Ilya Siamionau) and the AT Protocol Dart SDK (by Shinya Kato).That could be more helpful in the months to come as the bump that came from Bluesky’s public launch last month has since tapered off.A third recipient is SkyFeed, a custom tool that lets anyone — even non-developers —

and building or subscribing to feeds that present its data in different ways beyond the default timeline Bluesky itself offers."},"Twitter’s former head of Trust & Safety, Yoel Roth, joins Tinder

paperwork":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TC.png?w=730","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/11/stell-raises-new-tranche-of-funding-to-keep-engineers-building-not-filling-out-paperwork/","content":"Stell was originally planning to roll out a tool to digitize specifications and technical contracts — something almost like a purchasing or supply chain tool — so that, for example, a company buying parts could build that technical contract on Stell (versus a PDF).Last month, the company closed a $4 million seed round led by Long Journey Ventures and Cyan & Scott Banister, with participation from Third Prime, Wischoff Ventures, Urban Innovation Fund, Forward Deployed VC, and Fulcrum Venture Group, as well as a select group of angel investors.“We have all these friends in the industry that feel like they’re paperwork engineers, instead of actually building these products and working on these missions to build new space stations or what the US will be up against in this next era,” McLemore said.The company has developed a tool for requirements management that allows teams to track, verify and validate requirements on complex projects.I think it is hard to compete, mostly because there’s just an inertia because it’s been so long since there’s been a competitor in the space that has been able to match the workflows that exist in that tool."},"Alphabet spin-off SIP launches Verrus, a data center concept built around battery ‘microgrids’":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1293443512.jpg?w=603","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/11/sip-verrus-data-center/","content":"Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners — the Alphabet spinout that focuses on building and backing new approaches to complicated infrastructure problems in areas like power, broadband and waste management — has launched its latest project, a new concept for more flexible data center energy management called Verrus.Verrus’s proposal is to instead use what Winer refers to as a “micro grid” that will include a high-capacity battery, which will mean it will be more flexible to deploy power to specific areas or even projects within a data center.(Alongside the new business, SIP is also launching the Data Center Flexibility Initiative to bring stakeholders like energy companies, tech giants and regulators together in the meantime.)The explosion of cloud computing and AI data computations present “a real challenge on the grid,” he said, and typically data centers are at capacity.A flexible energy management system would allow for what he described as “islands” in the data center during those hours."},"Musk’s Grok goes open-source and Reddit updates its IPO filing":{"img":null,"link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/11/musk-grok-reddit-ipo-filing/","content":"This is our Monday show, in

Reddit in its S-1 filing: “Given the broad awareness and brand recognition of Reddit, including as a result of the popularity of r/wallstreetbets among retail investors, and the direct access by retail investors to broadly available trading platforms, the market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could experience extreme volatility for reasons unrelated to our underlying business or macroeconomic or industry fundamentals, which could cause you to lose all or part of your investment if you are unable to sell your shares at or above the initial offering price.8% ( 1,760,000 shares) of Reddit’s Class A common stock will be offered through this program to 75,000 eligible Reddit users and moderators, certain board members, and friends and family of employees and directors.But the IPO could be volatile given that Reddit will allow its community members to sell their shares immediately, instead of being subject to the usual lock-up agreements that typically prevent investors from selling shares for six months after the IPO.Because only a set amount of stock is being made available through this program, if demand outweighs capacity, a waitlist will be offered.In its new filing, the company indicates that the Redditors in its directed share program will be able to sell at any time."},"Telegram founder says the company will become profitable next

says the company expects the new RFM-1 platform will work with a “majority” of the hardware on which Covariant software is already deployed.Now imagine trying to get that robot to work with a new part, new material or even do a wholly different task.“Coupling the intelligence inflection point with the hardware inflection point is where we will see even more explosion of robot applications.During a live demo, the system reacts to inputs like “pick up the red object” and even the more semantically complex, “pick up what you put on your feet before you put on your shoes,” which caused the robot to correctly pick up the apple and a pair of socks, respectively.“We do like a lot of the work that is happening in the more general purpose robot hardware space,” says Chen."},"EU’s use of Microsoft 365 found to breach data protection

complies with EU or Member State law; or, if outside the region to be processed for another purpose under third-country law there must be essentially equivalent protection applied.The regulator, which oversees’ EU institutions’ compliance with data protection rules, opened a probe of the Commission’s use of Microsoft 365 and other US cloud services back in May 2021.The data supervisor has ordered the Commission to suspend all data flows resulting from its use of Microsoft 365 to Microsoft and its affiliates and sub-processors located in countries outside the EU/EEA not covered by an EU adequacy decision on data transfers — again, with a deadline of December 9 for this.A lengthy investigation into the European Union’s use of Microsoft 365 has found the Commission breached the bloc’s data protection rules through its use of the cloud-based productivity software.But for much of the period the EDPS was investigating the Commission’s use of Microsoft 365 there was no deal in place covering data transfers from the EU to the US."},"SuperAGI snags funding from Jan Koum’s Newlands

Griffin Bank, an API-driven banking-as-a-service (BaaS) platform, just obtained a banking license, roughly one year after starting the application process.Griffin is less likely to offer banking accounts directly to consumers, but rather to other businesses that want to offer embedded financial solutions such as savings and safeguarding accounts as well as accounts for holding client money.1 million, Griffin just raised another $24 million (£19 million) in an extended Series A round that was led by MassMutual Ventures, NordicNinja and Breega, with participation from existing investors Notion Capital and EQT Ventures.Co-founder David Jarvis told TechCrunch that Griffin’s customers will be able to have funds pooled into their “own bank” rather than larger banks, many of which have stopped offering these kinds of services.“When people talk about banking as a service, they tend to conflate actual banking with many non-banking services that still tick the box, where it looks like a bank and smells like a bank, but it’s not."}}

that it intends to halt production for six weeks to get its business back in order.Fisker’s finances are back in the news after the company warned back in February that it didn’t have enough cash to make it through its next year.Fisker is hardly the first electric vehicle company to struggle to stay afloat, but given the issues its cars suffer from, there’s good reason to be skeptical of the company’s product.Softening demand growth for EVs is making the normal challenges of scaling a company all the harder for Fisker and its peers.Founding a startup, finding product-market fit and scaling a business are hard challenges, and even though the venture-backed startup model has helped create a host of incredibly valuable companies, the reality is that most startups fail."},"How crypto exchange Backpack climbed its way to success after its major investor FTX

of the foundational design goals for Backpack was to solve the problems exposed by FTX, he addedUnlike FTX, Backpack designed their exchange’s system to make sure that balances are controlled by independent entities, or nodes, that can collectively validate each other so that every order, cancellation, deposit, withdrawal and so on are checked.Image Credits: CoinGecko (opens in a new window)“We have caught lightning in a bottle in a weird way, where people just started talking about Backpack as this new up-and-coming exchange and seeing the promises of a next generation exchange that can learn from a lot of the lessons and mistakes that were made of previous exchanges,” Ferrante said.We spent all this time building this protocol and it was like an on-the-ground knock-out and [we] needed to be resuscitated back to life,” Armani Ferrante, co-founder of Backpack and the NFT collection Mad Lads, told TechCrunch.Backpack’s founders, who are building a crypto exchange and wallet, have experienced strong growth since launching in 2022.For example, the NFT collection Solana Monkey Business has an xNFT with a newsletter that’s called the Banana Split and it’s regularly updated so when someone has the NFT on Backpack, they can access the newsletter directly in their wallet, he noted."},"Ramp CEO says the fintech startup is just scratching the

the fintech category’s rapid growth over the past few years, Glyman started building his first fintech startup before the hype cycle.Glyman recently said on the TechCrunch Found podcast that despite how much his unicorn corporate card and expense startup has grown so far, it’s only tapped in to 1% of its potential market share.The times have changed for fintechs and Glyman talked about what it has been like building and fundraising for a fintech startup as the market has shifted over the past decade.When the team was building Paribus, the generative AI technology to craft the emails was still relatively rudimentary and the rest of the company’s AI technology was built on very simple language models.The startup used AI to craft emails for its users to send to stores to get a price

Ethos Fund two years ago to bridge opportunities and startup communities between Vietnam and the United States.”Tapping into their edtech backgrounds, Yi and Shin also believe that venture capital is education, so they host live programs and events.Yi says the five-person firm is one of the few, if not the only, funds focused exclusively on strengthening opportunities between these two countries.However, David Yi and Simon Shin are out to apply that concept to the world of venture capital.”Mirrorscape’s new AR tabletop platform could enhance your D&D campaignBut there are always new things to learn, and in this particular instance, Yi learned two things: He indeed didn’t know how to manage people professionally, and the technology couldn’t scale unless they got to

a husband and wife founding team with three young children, it’s not easy to maintain a work-life balance, but Young says she and her husband carve out work time and family time and try not to let one bleed into the other to maintain the proper focus for both the family and the company.“We felt very strongly about simulations being the future of business, and I think we were just waiting for someone to build it – and then suddenly, it’s 2020 — and our time got freed up because we left Autodesk.TigerEye CEO Tracy Young and her husband and CTO Ralph Gootee helped build their previous startup, PlanGrid, into a $100 million ARR business before selling it to Autodesk for $875 million in 2018.She says during the day when they’re at work, they have others who are responsible for the kids, but at night the couple fiercely protects dinner time as family time.So if you are going to alter territories, hire more or fewer people or change sales quotas, as a few examples, you can test drive your plan first before you present it to your board or your team, and have a sense of how these moves will impact the business."},"Final chance to host your own Side Event at TechCrunch Early

Meta’s social networks privately without charge is not currently an option in the EU despite the adtech giant (briefly) allowing regional users who exercised a right to object to its tracking to opt out of use of their data for ads last year — when it was claiming a so-called “legitimate interest” (LI) for ads processing, after its earlier claim (contractual necessity) was found to breach data protection rules in January 2023.Critics say Meta’s approach relies upon economic coercion to manipulate users to accept tracking, arguing it does not comply with the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — which requires consent to be freely given.The Court of Justice of the EU went on to dismantle Meta’s ability to claim a LI for the processing in a ruling last summer — after which Meta said it would shift to consent.The ex ante market power regulation puts limits on how gatekeepers can use people’s data for ads — requiring they obtain explicit consent.Gatekeepers’ compliance with the DMA and VLOPs’ compliance with the DSA is overseen by the European Commission itself, which recently sent Meta a request for information about its controversial “consent or pay” offer under the DSA."},"Who needs free shipping? Delivery startup Ingrid banks $23M to provide a viable alternative":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-19-at-09.32.54.png?w=534","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/19/ingrid-receives-23m-to-expand-an-e-commerce-delivery-platform-that-snubs-free-shipping/","content":"So, while a delivery platform might potentially consider a product that effectively builds an Amazon Prime-style competitor for retailers that want to offer those benefits but want to avoid paying fees to Amazon, or losing critical customer ownership in the process, Zaleski said that Ingrid will not be the one to build it.So, while the company has now an impressive 20% share of the consumer market in its home country of Sweden — which Zaleski spelled out to me as “more than 15% of consumers” shopping online will use Ingrid in one way or another — and while that will serve it to grow well in the years to come judging by the acceleration of the business now; it spells more challenges when Ingrid wants to break into totally new markets.That is one reason why Prime and Amazon continue to kill it in the market, and why they have forced the hand of so many others to figure out how also to provide “free shipping.Turning back to Ingrid the startup, the company’s basic understanding is that for any retailer that is not Amazon, fulfilment and logistics are not the core of what they do, and for those whose speciality is delivery, they are not experts in e-commerce, so providing a service that can stitch these together better will be useful to both.Using data science and some big ideas about how delivery will evolve in the years ahead — it thinks we should move away from free shipping — the company is on an ambitious track to expand to more markets in Europe."},"Uber leads $100M investment in African mobility fintech Moove as valuation hits

an African mobility fintech that offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers, has raised $100 million in a funding round as it plots expansion into new markets.Moove says it plans to use the new capital to expand its revenue-based vehicle financing platform to 16 markets by the end of 2025.Uber’s decision to back Moove, marking its first investment in an Africa-founded startup, suggests a concerted effort to ensure a steady supply of drivers for its ride-hailing platform (Moove plans to introduce 45,000 new vehicles to the Uber platform.Though drivers join Moove to find a source of income, these macroeconomic conditions have placed significant strain on them, leading some to protest that the working arrangements with the vehicle financing platform (particularly regarding the weekly remittance to the platform) add more stress than relief.He attributed this stance to the mission behind founding the company with co-founder Jide Odunsi: to offer access to vehicle financing and generate employment opportunities and income for drivers in the country and across Africa."},"Truecaller adds a new AI feature to detect and block more spam calls":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/truecaller-max-spam-blocking.jpg?w=600","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/18/truecaller-automatically-reject-all-spam-calls-android-update/","content":"A new “Max” update for Android premium subscribers uses AI to block every single call that doesn’t come from an approved contact, or that its AI determines might be spam, TechCrunch has learned, even if they’re not already listed on Truecaller’s database.Truecaller is also leaning on the current interest in all things AI: Caller ID and spam protection are Truecaller’s two core features, and it’s betting that any reservations about AI could be outbalanced by curiosity about how well it could work to get Truecaller’s main job done… while also growing premium sign-ups in the process.Meanwhile, in India — Truecaller’s biggest market with 259 million users — the Indian telecom regulator recently proposed a Truecaller-like caller ID service, to be implemented across all telecom networks in the country, in a bid to better tackle spam.Caller ID app Truecaller today blocks between 38 and 40 billion spam calls annually for its 374 million+ users.The update is Android-only: Apple does not allow Truecaller (or other caller ID services) to check callers’ spammer status to block calls automatically on iOS."},"Nvidia’s keynote at GTC held some

board of investments voted to decrease its allocation range to venture capital and growth equity from between 15% and 30% of the pension system’s private equity portfolio, to between 5% and 25%.Considering the pension was currently underallocated to its existing range, this move was likely to free up capital for other strategies, as opposed to a play to reduce the size of its actual venture portfolio.”Neither Borton nor Gao thinks we should expect any significant changes for LP allocation into venture this year — but there will always be exceptions.As of the end of 2023, the organization reported that the five all-time best performing funds in its private equity portfolio were venture funds, including four funds from Union Square Ventures with vintages spanning from 2012 to 2016.The Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association (LACERA) voted to decrease its allocation range to venture capital at a March 13 meeting."},"Mintlify says customer GitHub tokens

customers that “no further action is required on your part.”While the blog post describes the person who discovered the vulnerability as a bug bounty reporter, the company’s co-founder Wang described the events as malicious.”In a post discussing the breach on Hacker News, Wang said a vulnerability in its systems was leaking the company’s internal admin credentials to customers.In a blog post Monday, Mintlify blamed its March 1 incident on a vulnerability in its own systems, but said 91 of its customers had their GitHub tokens compromised as a result."},"Nvidia launches NIM to make it

pull in custom data a lot easier.At its GTC conference, Nvidia today announced Nvidia NIM, a new software platform designed to streamline the deployment of custom and pre-trained AI models into production environments.Nvidia is already working with Amazon, Google and Microsoft to make these NIM microservices available on SageMaker, Kubernetes Engine and Azure AI, respectively.With NIM, Nvidia clearly aims to create an ecosystem of AI-ready containers that use its hardware as the foundational layer with these curated microservices as the core software layer for companies that want to speed up their AI roadmap.NIM takes the software work Nvidia has done around inferencing and optimizing models and makes it easily accessible by combining a given model with an optimized inferencing engine and then packing this into a container, making that accessible as a microservice."},"Nvidia enlists humanoid robotics’ biggest names for new AI platform,

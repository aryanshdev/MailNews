there, Tesla had Amazon beat: The Supercharger team was told that the network was profitable, the source said, even before other automakers gained access.On Friday, Musk said that Tesla will spend $500 million on expanding and upgrading the Supercharger network.Tesla opened the first Supercharger station in September 2012 as the first examples of the Model S prowled the streets.CommentAt the start of the year, Tesla’s Supercharger team was tasked with the impossible.Tesla was previously in a strong position to win awards through the federally funded National Electric Vehicle

550 employees across autonomous vehicle company Motional have been laid off, according to information taken from WARN notice filings and sources at the company.An employee at Motional who spoke to TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity said every team has been affected, with high-level departures including the company’s chief operating officer, Abe Ghabra.A week ago, Hyundai pumped Motional with a $475 million round and spent another $448 million to buy 11% of Aptiv’s common equity interest in the company.One of the sources at Motional told TechCrunch the company has a lot of

far":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Sam-Altman-OpenAI-DSC02880.jpg?w=1024","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/10/openais-chatgpt-announcement-what-we-know-so-far/","content":"”Altman’s wording was presumably alluding to a Reuters report published earlier this week, suggesting that OpenAI plans to announce an AI-powered search product on Monday — stealing some thunder from the Google I/O developer conference, which starts Tuesday.According to The Information, the product will be partly powered by Bing (Microsoft is a major OpenAI investor and partner); Bloomberg said it will work as a feature within ChatGPT, allowing the chatbot to search the web and cite sources — making it less of a black box that returns answers of unknown origin.So in theory, at least, OpenAI could announce a search feature Monday and Altman’s insistence that it’s “not a search engine” could still be true.” CEO Sam Altman, meanwhile, promoted the event with the message, “not gpt-5, not a search engine, but we’ve been hard at work on some new stuff we think people will love!”The Information and Bloomberg had previously reported that OpenAI has a search product in development."},"Meesho, an

its 2023 Environmental Performance report, SAP reported it has achieved net-zero carbon emissions across its own operations, which include heating and cooling, corporate car use, and electricity used by its buildings and data centers.To that end, she says one of the things that attracted her to SAP was its own commitment to sustainability.SAP appears to be heavily reliant on carbon offsets, in part because the majority of its emissions fall under scope 3, which covers pollution produced by the company’s products or services but lies outside the company’s control.She also recognizes that being part of SAP is both part of the problem as a high-tech company, yet one that is also helping manage the supply chain of a majority of companies in those same systems.SAP’s own experience shows how hard it is to walk the line between sustainability and profitability given the tools that are available to them and their customers."},"Why Apple’s ‘Crush’ ad is so

very possible that generative AI will one day be able to re-create scenes like this.Those are the questions I kept asking myself Wednesday at a showing of the top 10 finalists at Runway’s second annual AI Film Festival, which are available on-demand on Runway’s website as of this morning.CommentIn the third episode of “Creative Dialogues,” an interview series produced by the filmmaking division of generative AI startup Runway, multimedia artist Claire Hentschker expresses a fear that AI will commoditize the artistic process to the point where art homogenizes, regressing to a sort of derivative sameness.All of the movies submitted to the festival incorporated AI in some form, including AI-generated backdrops and animations, synthetic voice-overs, and bullet time-style special effects.Even otherwise strong scripts were sometimes let down by underwhelming generative AI effects."},"Women in AI: Rachel Coldicutt researches how technology impacts

lot of my AI work has been in policy framing and social impact assessments, working with government departments, charities and all kinds of businesses to help them use AI and related tech in intentional and trustworthy ways.Everyone who works in AI needs to be realistic about the historical, long-standing association of tech R&D with military development; we need to champion, support, and demand innovation that starts in and is governed by communities so that we get outcomes that strengthen society, not lead to increased destruction.Our work made it clear that AI is not a consequence-free set of technologies but something that has diffuse real-world implications for people and societies.The climate impacts of AI — the use of water, energy and critical minerals — and the health and social justice impacts for people and communities affected by exploitation of natural resources need to be top of the list for responsible development.We’ve developed a robust process for this at Careful Trouble, where we work with boards and senior teams, starting with mapping how AI can, and can’t, support your vision and values; understanding where problems are too complex and variable to enhance by automation, and where it will create benefit; and lastly, developing an active risk management framework."},"StrictlyVC London welcomes Phoenix Court and

Layup was likely able to close a large funding round so quickly at least in part because the founders themselves have deep experience with the issues that plague domestic manufacturing.The bulk of the work ahead for the company, and where it will most strongly be able to differentiate itself, is in the software domain, though it will likely be a few years until Layup can accept any CAD model from customers and deliver a part in a matter of days.Instead, Layup aims to return small parts in three days, and for larger components, the company targets two weeks — all at a lower cost to the customer.CommentScarcely five months after its founding, hard tech startup Layup Parts has landed a $9 million round of financing led by Founders Fund to transform composites manufacturing.But that doesn’t mean the company isn’t moving fast: With the new funding, Layup aims to have a factory online making parts for customers by the end of the third quarter of this year."},"Startups Weekly:

rabid fans that it seems rude not to do a quick roundup: Apple ran a short, 40-ish minute event this week, where it showed off new iPad Airs, new iPad Pros (with a fancy new stacked screen technology), a new Magic Keyboard, a new Pencil Pro, brand-new M4 chips, and much more.Iconiq Capital, the private office that’s been babysitting Mark Zuckerberg’s and Jack Dorsey’s cash piles since

in a post on the company’s official blog Friday, Anthropic will begin letting teens and preteens use third-party apps (but not its own apps, necessarily) powered by its AI models so long as the developers of those apps implement specific safety features and disclose to users which Anthropic technologies they’re leveraging.In a support article, Anthropic lists several safety measures devs creating AI-powered apps for minors should include, like age verification systems, content moderation and filtering and educational resources on “safe and responsible” AI use for minors.Anthropic’s change in policy comes as kids and teens are increasingly turning to generative AI tools for help not only with schoolwork but personal issues, and as rival generative AI vendors — including Google and OpenAI — are exploring more use cases aimed at children.CommentAI startup Anthropic is changing its policies to allow minors to use its generative AI systems — in certain circumstances, at least.The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) late last year pushed for governments to regulate the use of generative AI in education, including implementing age limits for users and guardrails on data protection and user privacy."},"The buzziest EV IPO of the year is a Chinese

company’s stock price soared 38% in the first few minutes of trading, giving Zeekr a potential $7 billion valuation.Other Chinese companies disrupting the European EV market include BYD, SAIC and Great Wall Motor.Zeekr said in filings that it is still preparing financial statements for the first quarter of 2024 and that it expects vehicle sales revenue to be higher than Q1 2023, but lower than Q4 2023 due to “seasonality that impacted our delivery volume, as well as lower average selling price primarily caused by the change in our product mix.Hurdles like the enactment of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA), which results in increased scrutiny of Chinese firms and additional oversight that could put a company at risk of delisting or make investors lose

metrics also tell us that the venture funds reaching maturity in SFERS’s portfolio are not returning capital at a rate high enough to overcome the losses of the portfolio’s newer fund commitments.The pension fund made 15 commitments to venture funds in 2023 and has made two commitments so far this year, including a $75 million commitment into IVP XVIII and a $40 million commitment to Volition Capital Fund V.So while venture funds don’t seem on the path to knock it out of the park this year in terms of performance, the worst of the downturn’s effects may already be behind us.While they don’t tell us about each fund’s individual performance, or how funds nearing maturity are doing specifically, these numbers do tell us that overall fund performance is down.For example, the pension fund has invested more than $273 million into Notable Capital, $250 million in NEA funds and $69 million in Mayfield in the last decade, among many others."},"Threat actor says he scraped 49M Dell

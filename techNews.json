climate impacts of AI — the use of water, energy and critical minerals — and the health and social justice impacts for people and communities affected by exploitation of natural resources need to be top of the list for responsible development.Everyone who works in AI needs to be realistic about the historical, long-standing association of tech R&D with military development; we need to champion,

part because the majority of its emissions fall under scope 3, which covers pollution produced by the company’s products or services but lies outside the company’s control.She also recognizes that being part of SAP is both part of the problem as a high-tech company, yet one that is also helping manage the supply chain of a majority of companies in those same systems.SAP’s own experience shows

Layup was likely able to close a large funding round so quickly at least in part because the founders themselves have deep experience with the issues that plague domestic manufacturing.The bulk of the

customers and deliver a part in a matter of days.Instead, Layup aims to return small parts in three days, and for larger components, the company targets two weeks — all at a lower cost to the customer.CommentScarcely five months after its founding, hard tech startup Layup Parts has landed a $9 million round of financing led by Founders Fund to transform composites manufacturing.But that

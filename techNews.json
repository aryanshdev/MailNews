turbulent at best, and you have a situation in which an accelerator is in bankruptcy and startups are closing over the potential sale of share warrants.That said, with Newchip in liquidation and Techstars pushing ahead with its revamp, we are likely closer to the end of the accelerator shakeup than its beginning.In the case of Newchip, the accelerator appeared to promise a bit more than it could deliver."},"Police resurrect Lockbit’s site and troll the ransomware

members of Stack Overflow’s developer community rebelled against the changes, pointing out concerns related to the validity of information generated by AI, information overload, and data privacy for individual contributors on the platform.Traffic to the platform has reportedly dipped significantly since the release of capable new generative AI models last year — models that in many cases were trained on data from Stack Overflow.At the same time, Stack Overflow will benefit from OpenAI’s expertise in developing new generative AI integrations on the Stack Overflow platform.Stack Overflow

Institute.Echoing another major theme in the administration’s rhetoric, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Arati Prabhakar said Sunday that when the CHIPS Act was passed, semiconductor manufacturing had become “dangerously concentrated in just one part of the world” (presumably referring to China).President Joe Biden’s administration is looking to fund efforts that improve semiconductor manufacturing by using digital twins.For example, auto manufacturers are looking to use digital twins of their factories to experiment with new manufacturing processes without disrupting production."},"Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo talks about AI, chatbot platform Poe, and why OpenAI is not a

to secure a position as one of the top websites where people could get their questions answered?The site surfaces the AI-written answer to some questions with a link that lets you chat with Poe if you have further questions.D’Angelo said that Quora is seeing record numbers of users despite the proliferation of AI tools — although he declined to update the 400 million monthly active users figure it disclosed last July.It was certainly a rocky time for OpenAI, but it was perhaps doubly so for D’Angelo, since the drama was playing out while his own company, Quora, was taking big steps towards AI."},"Sequoia’s Jess Lee explains how early-stage startups can identify product-market

sum, the theory goes like this: Startups all, more or less, fit into one of these three archetypes, so identifying which archetype a company fits in can help it focus and develop.During her presentation on the framework, Lee said that Sequoia does not have a favored category among the three.For deep tech and moonshots — two common kinds of startups found in the “Future Vision” category — fundraising “was easier in a zero-interest-rate period when there was a ton of capital flowing in,” Lee said.Her conclusion drives home one of the most critical aspects of building an early-stage

call Resolve a microcalorimeter spectrometer because each of its 36 pixels is measuring tiny amounts of heat delivered by each incoming X-ray, allowing us to see the chemical fingerprints of elements making up the sources in unprecedented detail.”The mission’s imaging instrument, Resolve, has a 36-pixel image sensor.The device produces a spectrum of X-ray sources between 400 and 12,000 electron volts — up to 5,000 times the energy of visible light — with unprecedented detail.Equipped with an extraordinary array of pixels, the Resolve instrument can detect “soft” X-rays, which possess an

Together AI, a cloud GPU host that also conducts generative AI research, in March landed $106 million in a Salesforce-led round.“Given hyperscaler dominance of the overall public cloud market, which demands vast investments in infrastructure and range of services that make little or no revenue, challengers like CoreWeave have an opportunity to succeed with a focus on premium AI services without the burden of hypercaler-level investments overall,” he said.As the generative AI boom times continue, so does the demand for the hardware to run and train generative AI models at scale."},"The Rabbit

    "content": "Apple sent threat notifications to iPhone users in 92 countries on Wednesday, warning them that may have been targeted by mercenary spyware attacks.” “Although our investigations can never achieve absolute certainty, Apple threat notifications are high-confidence alerts that a user has been individually targeted by a mercenary spyware attack and should be taken very seriously,” it added.“Apple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID -xxx-,” it wrote in the warning to affected customers.“We are unable to provide more information about what caused us to send you this notification, as that may help mercenary spyware attackers adapt their behavior to evade detection in the future,” Apple told affected customers.”The warning to customers adds: “Mercenary spyware attacks, such as those using Pegasus from the NSO Group, are exceptionally rare and vastly more sophisticated than regular cybercriminal activity or consumer malware."

    "content": "Regardless, Ng’s appointment can only be helpful for advancing Amazon’s profile in the realm of AI, since the company stands to gain more thought leadership on real innovation in the space, not just making follow-on moves.The company announced on Thursday that Andrew Ng, known for building AI at large tech companies, is joining its board of directors.And given the AI whiplash that every big tech company is currently dealing with, it feels timely that McGrath is stepping away from the board now.Ng has also served as the chief scientist and VP at Chinese search giant Baidu, and he founded and led Google Brain, which was that search giant’s first big foray into building and applying AI tech across its products.After many costly years of going all-out on building out an entertainment empire (Amazon spent almost $19 billion on its video and music business in 2023), it’s interesting to see that McGrath, who would have been an important advocate and advisor on that strategy, is not going to stand for reelection."

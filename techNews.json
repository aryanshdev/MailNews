is Apple iPad Event day, and we’re ready to bring you all the iPad goodness you can stand, including if some of the rumors are true of what’s coming, like a new iPad Pro, iPad Air, Apple Pencil and a keyboard case.The company did that by bringing OLED to iPad for the very first time, suggesting that the technology helps get the light and color accuracy that iPad Pro owners want – but that it lacks the brightness.Read more“We’ve always envisioned iPad as a magical sheet of glass,” said John Ternus, SVP, Hardware Engineering during Apple’s iPad event in Cupertino on Tuesday.Read more\nImage

screens – “Tandem OLED” – in its new iPad Pro":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/iPad-Pro.png?w=715","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/07/apple-tandem-oled-ipad/","content":"Previously seen on the company’s high-end studio displays, the new iPad Pro also gets a nanotexture glass option to iPad Pro for the very first time: Nanotexture glass is precisely etched at a nanometer scale, maintaining image quality and contrast while scattering ambient light for even less glare.The company did that by bringing OLED to iPad for the very first time, suggesting that the technology helps get the light and color accuracy that iPad Pro owners want – but that it lacks the brightness.The company solved that by creating the Tandem OLED screen, which can support an incredible 1,000 nits of full-screen brightness for both SDR and HDR content, and 1,600 nits of peak HDR brightness.As a bonus of using OLED, it enables the company to deliver sub-millisecond control over the color and luminance of each pixel, which means that highlights in photo and video can appear brighter, while blacks can be deeper and more true, with a huge additional responsibility boost in moving content.Yeah, you can put an OLED screen in an iPad, but then you lose the brightness that iPad Pro users are used to."},"Apple finally places front camera on iPad on the landscape edge — like it should be":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/iPad-Air-Photo-Retouch.png?w=718","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/07/apple-finally-places-front-camera-on-ipad-on-the-landscape-edge-like-it-should-be/","content":"Apple announced two new iPad Air models today— an 11-inch and a 13-inch model — at its iPad event on Tuesday.“We’ve also redesigned the iPad Air to put the front-facing camera on the landscape edge and a feature center stage that uses machine learning to keep everyone in the field of view automatically.However, one of the important updates for people who take a lot of video calls was Apple shifting the camera to the landscape edge.The new iPads are shipping next week, with the 11-inch model priced at $599 and the 13-inch model priced at $799.Until now, the camera on the iPad was on the portrait edge, which meant you had to put the iPad in portrait mode while taking video calls."},"Apple iPad Pro gets an M4 chip and OLED

with 128GB for $599 (or $799 for the 13-inch option), Apple is adding more storage options — 256GB, 512GB and 1TB.The most important addition to the new iPad Air is that it now comes in two sizes.The

the autonomous vehicle startup borne out of a $4 billion joint venture between Hyundai and automotive supplier Aptiv, will pause its commercial operations and delay plans to launch a driverless service as it undergoes a restructuring, TechCrunch has learned.Motional will halt its commercial operation, which today includes robotaxi rides with a human safety driver behind the wheel, in Las Vegas and Santa Monica, Calif.Motional has pushed its plan to launch a commercial driverless robotaxi service — meaning no human safety operator on board — to 2026, two years later than planned.Earlier this year, Motional’s future was put in doubt after Aptiv announced plans to reduce its ownership interest and stop allocating capital to the venture due to the high cost of commercializing a robotaxi business and the long road ahead to profits.During the all-hands, CEO Karl Iagnemma told employees that the vision had not changed and that Hyundai’s recent investment into Motional is a sign of the company’s support and belief that they’re on the right track, according to sources who listened to the call."},"Wiz raises $1B at a $12B valuation to expand its cloud

launched its first spacecraft, called Otter Pup, nearly a year ago with ambitious plans to use it to rendezvous and dock with another satellite on orbit.Starfish Space’s ambitious first mission to demonstrate on-orbit rendezvous and docking tech has officially come to a close, with the startup managing to complete some of the objectives thanks to a little help from an unexpected partner: space logistics company D-Orbit.Starfish Space pulls Otter Pup servicing vehicle back from ‘the brink of death’That’s no easy task: they had to find an operational spacecraft with no conflicting mission objectives, and that had the requisite delta-V — that is, enough onboard propulsion — to maneuver close enough to Otter Pup.Starfish and D-Orbit faced additional challenges given that Otter Pup’s thrusters were dead, and the two companies are headquartered, respectively, in Washington state and Italy.Although Otter Pup was unable to attempt docking, Link and Starfish co-founder Trevor Bennett both emphasized that the mission fueled the team with plentiful valuable data to inform future missions."},"Legion’s founder aims to close the gap between what employers and workers

surprisingly, the event may also see the launch of the new M4 chip, a little over six months after the company unveiled three new M3 chips in one fell swoop.Well, for starters, word on the street is that Apple launched the M3 later than expected (likely owing to supply chain issues), forcing the company to launch all three chips at the same event.According to the rumor mill, that list includes: a new iPad Pro, iPad Air, Apple Pencil and a keyboard case.9-inch iPad Air and new gestures for the Apple Pencil.An announcement may be even more pressing, given that the Microsoft/ARM chips are said to offer “industry-leading performance” — an apparent shot across Apple’s bow."},"Tubi calls on indie filmmakers and their fans to help beef up original content

Gurson, Rad AI’s CEO told TechCrunch.Some incumbents have been trying to add GenAI functionality to their radiology reporting software over the past 18 months, but Rad AI doesn’t consider these companies to be true competitors yet.Six years later, Rad AI’s products are used by about a third of U.ai and Q Bio, the firm’s latest bet is on a company that makes radiologists’ workload easier by

Imagine, Meta AI’s new image generator, also displayed a peculiar predisposition to generating Indian men wearing a turban, among other biases.[gallery ids=\"2700287,2700291,2700290\"]Another prompt we tried was “Indian content creator,” and it generated an image of a female creator repeatedly.Two Indian men sitting next to each other:[gallery ids=\"2700281,2700282,2700283\"]Additionally, we tried generating a collage of images with prompts, such as an Indian man with different hairstyles.However, in images generates Meta’s AI, roughly 3-4 out of 5 images representing Indian males would be wearing a turban.The latest culprit in this area is Meta’s AI chatbot, which, for some reason, really wants to add turbans to any image of an Indian man."},"Daloopa trains AI to automate financial

popular chatbots such as ChatGPT, has led to a major new threat landscape involving AI-generated “deepfakes” designed to perpetuate disinformation.Earlier today, OpenAI launched a new deepfake detector for disinformation researchers, designed to help identify fake content generated by its own DALL-E image generator, while it also joined the steering committee for industry body the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), which already counts members such as Adobe, Microsoft, Google, and Intel.This would involve issuing grants to a handful of organizations, including

Honeycomb was gearing up to raise its Series B earlier this year, one of the first calls Ben-Zaken made was to solo venture capitalist Oren Zeev, who’s known for being one of the largest shareholders in Navan, Houzz, Next Insurance and Tipalti.He launched Honeycomb Insurance in 2019, and after spending two years building the company’s computer vision and AI-driven property “inspection” technology, the company sold its first policy in 2021.The company raised a $15 million Series A in early 2022 and is currently on track to sell $130 million of insurance premiums in 2024, a threefold increase from last year.In other words, Zeev isn’t worried that major players will encroach on Honeycomb’s territory, as they did on Ben-Zaken’s first startup.Besides the company’s fast growth, what attracted Zeev to Honeycomb is that landlord insurance is a “sleepy” industry ready for innovation, but also the sector is not large enough for insurance giants to want to tackle it."},"Akamai confirms

Africa is the e-commerce giant’s first marketplace in the sub-Saharan region (it already has an operation out of Egypt following the acquisition of Souq in 2017), and it will be going head-to-head in the country with local players like Takealot (majority-owned by media giant Naspers), as well as Makro and Bob Group’s bidorbuy to tap what is estimated to be e-commerce revenue worth $3 billion annually.Nevertheless, the debut has been a long time coming: Amazon had first said it would launch on the continent two years ago, in two countries, Nigeria and South Africa.The timing of Amazon’s launch also coincides with a surge in online shopping in South Africa following the pandemic, which has spurred increased investments from retailers in the e-commerce sector.South Africa is however a very specific market, different from most African countries, with mature retail networks, stable supply and very competitive e-commerce space,” Francis Dufay, Jumia CEO, said to TechCrunch about Amazon’s arrival.That in itself appeared to be building on Amazon putting South Africa and the wider continent of Africa into sharper focus overall: in 2020, it had announced its first AWS region for the continent, also out of South Africa."}}

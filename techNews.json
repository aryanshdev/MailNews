an African mobility fintech that offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers, has raised $100 million in a funding round as it plots expansion into new markets.He attributed this stance to the mission behind founding the company with co-founder Jide Odunsi: to offer access to vehicle financing and generate employment opportunities and income for drivers in the country and across Africa.Though drivers join Moove to find a source of income, these macroeconomic conditions have placed significant strain on them, leading some to protest that the working arrangements with the vehicle financing platform (particularly regarding the weekly remittance to the platform) add more stress than relief.Moove says it plans to use the new capital to expand its revenue-based vehicle financing platform to 16 markets by the end of 2025.This is up from the $550 million secured last August in a Mubadala-led equity and debt round."},"Truecaller adds a new AI feature to detect and block more spam calls":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/truecaller-max-spam-blocking.jpg?w=600","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/18/truecaller-automatically-reject-all-spam-calls-android-update/","content":"A new “Max” update for Android premium subscribers uses AI to block every single call that doesn’t come from an approved contact, or that its AI determines might be spam, TechCrunch has learned, even if they’re not already listed on Truecaller’s database.Truecaller is also leaning on the current interest in all things AI: Caller ID and spam protection are Truecaller’s two core features, and it’s betting that any reservations about AI could be outbalanced by curiosity about how well it could work to get Truecaller’s main job done… while also growing premium sign-ups in the process.Meanwhile, in India — Truecaller’s biggest market with 259 million users — the Indian telecom regulator recently proposed a Truecaller-like caller ID service, to be implemented across all telecom networks in the country, in a bid to better tackle spam.Caller ID app Truecaller today blocks between 38 and 40 billion spam calls annually for its 374 million+ users.The new feature underscores how Truecaller believes there could be a business opportunity banking on people fed up with spammers’ insidious ways — even if a fix could come at the expense of missing calls from unknown numbers and non-spammers that might actually be welcomed."},"Nvidia’s keynote at GTC held some

third-most-valuable company by market cap certainly had a fair number of fans in the audience.The company announced its brand-new Blackwell platform, which is an absolute monster.“I want to show you

board of investments voted to decrease its allocation range to venture capital and growth equity from between 15% and 30% of the pension system’s private equity portfolio, to between 5% and 25%.Considering the pension was currently underallocated to its existing range, this move was likely to free up capital for other strategies, as opposed to a play to reduce the size of its actual venture portfolio.As of the end of 2023, the organization reported that the five all-time best performing funds in its private equity portfolio were venture funds, including four funds from Union Square Ventures with vintages spanning from 2012 to 2016.”Neither Borton nor Gao thinks we should expect any significant changes for LP allocation into venture this year — but there will always be exceptions.The Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association (LACERA) voted to decrease its allocation range to venture capital at a March 13 meeting."},"Mintlify says customer GitHub tokens

became public last week when some users on Reddit and Hacker News commented after getting an email from Mintlify on Friday about the incident, days after the company’s blog post initially told customers that “no further action is required on your part.”While the blog post describes the person who discovered the vulnerability as a bug bounty reporter, the company’s co-founder Wang described the events as malicious.”In a post discussing the breach on Hacker News, Wang said a vulnerability in its systems was leaking the company’s internal admin credentials to customers.Those credentials could then be used to access the company’s internal endpoints to access other unspecified sensitive user information, Wang said."},"Nvidia launches NIM to make it smoother to deploy AI models into

company plans to add additional capabilities over time, including, for example, making the Nvidia RAG LLM operator available as a NIM, which promises to make building generative AI chatbots that can pull in custom data a lot easier.At its GTC conference, Nvidia today announced Nvidia NIM, a new software platform designed to streamline the deployment of custom and pre-trained AI models into production environments.Nvidia is already working with Amazon, Google and Microsoft to make these NIM microservices available on SageMaker, Kubernetes Engine and Azure AI, respectively.With NIM, Nvidia clearly aims to create an ecosystem of AI-ready containers that use its hardware as the foundational layer with these curated microservices as the core software layer for companies that want to speed up their AI roadmap.NIM takes the software work Nvidia has done around inferencing and optimizing models and makes it easily accessible by combining a given model with an optimized inferencing engine and then packing this into a container, making that accessible as a microservice."},"Nvidia enlists humanoid robotics’ biggest names for new AI platform,

notable that even X’s own boilerplate notification doesn’t explicitly accuse restricted users of being spammers; it just says there “may” be spam on their accounts or some (unspecified) form of platform manipulation going on (which, in the latter case, walks further away from the Article 17 exemption, unless it’s also platform manipulated related to “deceptive high-volume commercial content”, which would surely fit under the spam reason so why even bother mentioning platform manipulation?Users of Elon Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) continue complaining the platform is engaging in shadowbanning — aka restricting the visibility of posts by applying a “temporary” label to accounts that can limit the reach/visibility of content — without providing clarity over why it’s imposed the sanctions.Edwards points out that Article 17 of the pan-EU law requires X to provide a “clear and specific statement of reasons to any affected recipients for any restriction of the visibility of specific items of information” — with the law broadly draft to cover “any restrictions” on the visibility of the user’s content; any removal of their content; the disabling of access to content or demoting content.Running a search on X for the phrase “temporary label” shows multiple instances of users complaining about being told they’ve been flagged by the platform; and, per an automated notification, that the reach of their content “may” be affected.Musk says X will address shadowbanning ‘soon,’ but former Trust & Safety exec explains why that will be difficultElon Musk’s X faces

the closest to “open source” an AI model can be is when its developers release its weights, which is to say the exact attributes of the countless nodes of its neural networks, which perform vector mathematics operations in precise order to complete the pattern started by a user’s input.If they are really dedicated to open source development, this will be the first of many releases, and they will hopefully take the feedback of the community into account, release other crucial information, characterize the training data process, and further explain their approach.Elon Musk’s xAI released

{"Microsoft hires Inflection founders to run new consumer AI

has hired Mustafa Suleyman and Karen Simonyan, co-founders of high-profile AI startup Inflection AI, and several of their colleagues as the Satya Nadella-led cloud giant continues its aggressive push to attract top talent.In a blog post, Inflection AI said that it will shift its focus to the AI studio business, where it builds and tests customer generative AI models.Suleyman — also a co-founder of DeepMind, which Google bought in 2014 to bolster its own AI efforts — will run Microsoft’s newly formed consumer AI unit, called Microsoft AI, whereas Simonyan is joining the company as a chief scientist in the same new group.As part of the transition/situation, Inflection AI said it will host Inflection-2.At the time of the funding, Inflection AI said it is building the world’s largest AI cluster, featuring 22,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs."},"After raising $1.3B, Inflection got eaten alive by its biggest investor,

it was, here is “The new Inflection” now: minus its two most technically substantive co-founders (sorry Reid), minus the product that it invested a fortune in (there will be “no immediate changes” to Pi, which is basically a death warrant), minus some or most of the team that built it, and one imagines minus a lot of the money that was contingent on performance.We’ll see if Suleyman and Simonyan can lead the new AI division effectively — I don’t know about you, but I would be pretty skeptical of their instincts after seeing a billion-dollar enterprise evaporate so quickly.The new focus, on an “AI studio business, where custom generative AI models are crafted, tested and fine tuned for commercial customers,” probably would have been fine to focus on a year or two ago, but I suspect that at this point they will be fighting over crumbs.Inflection debuts its own foundation AI model to rival Google and OpenAI LLMsOf course, taking this shot was immensely costly, probably to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, with, I imagine, negligible revenue, relatively speaking.Inflection’s thesis was a conversational AI that you could talk to normally via multiple platforms, and which remembered you and previous conversations, making it more personal and useful."},"Nvidia and Qualcomm join Open Source Robotics Alliance to support ROS

Angeles-based Gitai said Tuesday that its autonomous robotic arm has nailed a tech demonstration outside the International Space Station.Autonomous robotic systems still have a ways to go before they render human labor obsolete, especially here on Earth; but in space, human labor is expensive (and dangerous), which provides an opening for a robotic alternative.5-meter autonomous robotic arm, which the startup calls S2, launched to the ISS aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 in January.Gitai CEO Sho Nakanose told TechCrunch in an interview last year that the company aims to reduce in-space labor costs by 100 times, in the same way that SpaceX and other providers have dramatically reduced launch costs.The eight-year-old startup plans to start offering on-orbit servicing in 2026."},"How crypto exchange

of the foundational design goals for Backpack was to solve the problems exposed by FTX, he addedUnlike FTX, Backpack designed their exchange’s system to make sure that balances are controlled by independent entities, or nodes, that can collectively validate each other so that every order, cancellation, deposit, withdrawal and so on are checked.Image Credits: CoinGecko (opens in a new window)“We have caught lightning in a bottle in a weird way, where people just started talking about Backpack as this new up-and-coming exchange and seeing the promises of a next generation exchange that can learn from a lot of the lessons and mistakes that were made of previous exchanges,” Ferrante said.We spent all this time building this protocol and it was like an on-the-ground knock-out and [we] needed to be resuscitated back to life,” Armani Ferrante, co-founder of Backpack and the NFT collection Mad Lads, told TechCrunch.Backpack’s founders, who are building a crypto exchange and wallet, have experienced strong growth since launching in 2022.For example, the NFT collection Solana Monkey Business has an xNFT with a newsletter that’s called the Banana Split and it’s regularly updated so when someone has the NFT on Backpack, they can access the newsletter directly in their wallet, he noted."},"TechCrunch Minute: EV makers are struggling, and Fisker’s in a particularly precarious position":{"img":null,"link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/19/techcrunch-minute-ev-makers-are-struggling-and-fiskers-in-a-particularly-precarious-position/","content":"The company said this week that it intends to halt production for six weeks to get its business back in order.Fisker’s finances are back in the news after the company warned back in February that it didn’t have enough cash to make it through its next year.Softening demand growth for EVs is making the normal challenges of scaling a company all the harder for Fisker and its peers.Fisker is hardly the first electric vehicle company to struggle to stay afloat, but given the issues its cars suffer from, there’s good reason to be skeptical of the company’s product.Founding a startup, finding product-market fit and scaling a business are hard challenges, and even though the venture-backed startup model has helped create a host of incredibly valuable companies, the reality is that most startups fail."},"Ramp CEO

the fintech category’s rapid growth over the past few years, Glyman started building his first fintech startup before the hype cycle.Glyman recently said on the TechCrunch Found podcast that despite how much his unicorn corporate card and expense startup has grown so far, it’s only tapped in to 1% of its potential market share.When the team was building Paribus, the generative AI technology to craft the emails was still relatively rudimentary and the rest of the company’s AI technology was built on very simple language models.The times have changed for fintechs and Glyman talked about what it has been like building and fundraising for a fintech startup as the market has shifted over the past decade.Glyman also spoke about how Ramp thinks about scaling and how the company approaches expanding into new categories."},"Facebook is trying to make ‘poking’ cool

subscription under privacy review":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1467844599.jpg?w=679","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/19/meta-ad-free-subscription-price-cut-offer/","content":"Using Meta’s social networks privately without charge is not currently an option in the EU despite the adtech giant (briefly) allowing regional users who exercised a right to object to its tracking to opt out of use of their data for ads last year — when it was claiming a so-called “legitimate interest” (LI) for ads processing, after its earlier claim (contractual necessity) was found to breach data protection rules in January 2023.Critics say Meta’s approach relies upon economic coercion to manipulate users to accept tracking, arguing it does not comply with the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — which requires consent to be freely given.Gatekeepers’ compliance with the DMA and VLOPs’ compliance with the DSA is overseen by the European Commission itself, which recently sent Meta a request for information about its controversial “consent or pay” offer under the DSA.The ex ante market power regulation puts limits on how gatekeepers can use people’s data for ads — requiring they obtain explicit consent.However the consent mechanism it devised is controversial because it offers users a Hobson’s Choice of paying it money to access the mainstream social networks or continuing to get free access but with tracking."},"Who needs free shipping? Delivery startup Ingrid banks $23M to provide a viable alternative":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-19-at-09.32.54.png?w=534","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/19/ingrid-receives-23m-to-expand-an-e-commerce-delivery-platform-that-snubs-free-shipping/","content":"So, while a delivery platform might potentially consider a product that effectively builds an Amazon Prime–style competitor for retailers that want to offer those benefits but want to avoid paying fees to Amazon, or losing critical customer ownership in the process, Zaleski said that Ingrid will not be the one to build it.So, while the company now has an impressive 20% share of the consumer market in its home country of Sweden — Zaleski told me that “more than 15% of consumers” shopping online will use Ingrid in one way or another — and while that will serve it to grow well in the years to come judging by the acceleration of the business, it spells more challenges when Ingrid wants to break into totally new markets.Turning back to Ingrid the startup, the company’s basic understanding is that for any retailer that is not Amazon, fulfillment and logistics are not the core of what they do, and for those whose speciality is delivery, they are not experts in e-commerce, so providing a service that can stitch these together better will be useful to both.That is one reason why Prime and Amazon continue to kill it in the market, and why they have forced the hand of so many others to figure out how also to provide “free shipping.Using data science and some big ideas about how delivery will evolve in the years ahead — for example, it thinks we should move away from free shipping — the company is on an ambitious track to expand to more markets in Europe."},"Uber leads $100M investment in African mobility fintech Moove as valuation hits

an African mobility fintech that offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers, has raised $100 million in a funding round as it plots expansion into new markets.Moove says it plans to use the new capital to expand its revenue-based vehicle financing platform to 16 markets by the end of 2025.Moove did not say who is leading the round, but sources close to the deal confirmed to TechCrunch that Uber led the Series B round, making it the company’s first investment in the African continent.He attributed this stance to the mission behind founding the company with co-founder Jide Odunsi: to offer access to vehicle financing and generate employment opportunities and income for drivers in the country and across Africa.Though drivers join Moove to find a source of income, these macroeconomic conditions have placed significant strain on them, leading some to protest that the working arrangements with the vehicle financing platform (particularly regarding the weekly

call that doesn’t come from an approved contact or that its AI determines might be spam, TechCrunch has learned, even if they’re not already listed on Truecaller’s database.Meanwhile, in India — Truecaller’s biggest market, with 259 million users — the Indian telecom regulator recently proposed a Truecaller-like caller ID service, to be implemented across all telecom networks in the country, in a bid to better tackle spam.Caller ID app Truecaller today blocks between 38 billion and 40 billion spam calls annually for its 374 million+ users.This isn’t the first AI feature at Truecaller: It

board of investments voted to decrease its allocation range to venture capital and growth equity from between 15% and 30% of the pension system’s private equity portfolio, to between 5% and 25%.Considering the pension was currently underallocated to its existing range, this move was likely to free up capital for other strategies, as opposed to a play to reduce the size of its actual venture portfolio.”Neither Borton nor Gao thinks we should expect any significant changes for LP allocation into venture this year — but there will always be exceptions.As of the end of 2023, the organization reported that the five all-time best performing funds in its private equity portfolio were venture funds, including four funds from Union Square Ventures with vintages spanning from 2012

already had a reputation for investing across both Europe and North America; its new funds will continue to follow that strategy, focusing specifically on B2B software companies.Following wider trend lines among other VCs in the region, new seed fund will favor European ventures, while the growth fund will focus on U.“Though it is a traditionally undervalued market, Europe accounts for over 30% of global revenues of top-performing B2B software companies at IPO,” Brennan O’Donnell — the co-lead of Frontline Growth  Stephen McIntyre — said in a statement.Besides its partners and offices in London, Dublin, Palo Alto and New York City, Frontline has also built a community of executives in the Europe and Middle East region to form a network that its portfolio companies can tap."},"Silence

there are still many diesel-powered commercial vehicles because it’s simply too expensive and too complicated to switch to an all electric vehicle fleet overnight.Both commercial fleet operations and financing have been designed for traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines.Chances are you may have noticed that many commercial vehicles are now electric vehicles — think about delivery vans, telecom minivans, utility maintenance trucks, etc.Leasing contracts — even for commercial vehicles, even for electric vehicles — end far too quickly.“We have developed a software solution to optimize fleet operations with electric vehicles."},"Farm to Feed is cutting food loss and creating data platform to better farming outcomes":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/b44e6255-28a2-49bf-8cfe-a0476db3db0e-1-e1711004658447.jpeg?w=690","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/21/farm-to-feed-cutting-food-loss/","content":"For Kenya, unlike the developed world, food loss, not waste, is the greater problem, with small-scale farmers, who account for 75% of the total agricultural output in the country, facing a myriad of challenges including inadequate market linkages and a failure to meet the cosmetic specifications for their produce.The startup aggregates farm produce, including imperfect crop products, like those considered too small, too big or oddly-shaped, and are often unwanted by distributors, and sells them to businesses like restaurants and food processors through its sales channels, including an online marketplace.Claire Van Enk, Farm to Feed CEO, co-founded the startup with Anouk Boertien and Zara Benosa in 2021, after pivoting from a non-profit program that provided food to people that lost their income during the Covid lockdown.It is also looking to tap the carbon market and has done a feasibility study in the hope of being pioneers of a new methodology by Verra, a nonprofit organization that operates standards in environmental and social markets, that quantifies emission reduction from reducing food loss and waste.“I saw firsthand what farmers were not selling even when markets returned, and it is a huge devastation not only on food security, but on the economy too,” Van Enk said, adding that food loss and food waste have a climate change aspect, with rotting foodstuff producing methane, a greenhouse gas that is worse than carbon dioxide."},"X launches top up packs for its developer

also limits to the number of upgrades developers can purchase.These paid upgrades will allow developers to fetch roughly 10,000 posts for $100 if they hit their existing tier’s limit midway through the month."},"Greenly lands $52M to help smaller companies track CO2

with an advantage: it’s applying SaaS to climate tech, and SaaS a business model that’s well understood.”The fact that the fundraise is a sizable Series B helps it stand out among climate tech companies, which tend to encounter hurdles after the early stages before growth equity can step in, the so-called missing middle.”Greenly’s Series B isn’t necessarily a sign that it’s getting easier for climate tech startups to bridge the middle rounds.That’s in part because Greenly is not a stereotypical hard-tech climate startup.Enter Greenly, a five-year-old, Paris-based outfit whose main product is carbon accounting software, which pulls in customer data, including utility data, freight bills, cloud computing usage, and financial records."},"Astera Labs’ IPO pops 72% on first day, showing that investor demand for tech with an AI twist is high":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1502217391.jpg?w=600","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/20/astera-labs-ipo-pops-54-showing-that-investor-demand-for-tech-with-an-ai-twist-is-high/","content":"While the company’s strong early trading will certainly engender critiques that it was mispriced, and that the company left money on the table, its bull-rush into public life may help other private-market tech companies find the courage to list their own shares after a long period of limited IPO activity.While the song and dance surrounding Astera Labs’ public offering has been noticeably quieter than that surrounding Reddit’s IPO, there’s reason to believe that it is more a test of the market’s demand for AI shares than Reddit’s own debut; while Reddit’s AI-based data business is certainly a growing portion of its operations, it remains a single-digit percentage of its anticipated 2023 per TechCrunch analysis.Reddit, the well-known social forum and AI data provider, is expected to price after the close of trading today and begin its own public saga tomorrow.But they’re certainly, I think, benefiting from that trend,” said Nick Einhorn, vice president of research at Renaissance Capital, a company that tracks the IPO market and offers public-offering focused ETFs.As TechCrunch reported earlier this week, some late-stage startups may not be able to go public below their last primary valuation — even if there founders are ok with hitting the public markets at a lower price — due to table stakes VC deal terms including dilution rights which would give investors the ability to block the deal."},"With backing from NATO Innovation Fund, OTB Ventures will invest $185M into European deep

the company has long intended to upgrade a second pad — SLC-40 at the neighboring Cape Canaveral Space Force Station — to expand its crew launch capacity.SpaceX is in the final stages of certifying a second pad for astronaut launches, which should ease launch site congestion and help the company scale the number of humans it sends to space.The company also installed a new emergency egress system at the pad to allow the crew a quick escape in the case of an anomaly.The system, which is essentially a long orange slide that stretches from the crew tower to the ground, will help SpaceX “scale to bigger towers and spaceships (think 100 people on Starship),” VP of Launch Kiko Dontchev said in a social media post.Teams test the new emergency chutes from the pad 40 crew tower in Florida

boat maker Candela is approaching cruising speed with $25 million in new funding and the first commercial deployment of its new P-12 ferry in New Zealand.Just last week, the P-12 was given its first assignment: ferry people around New Zealand’s Lake Manapōuri, a scenic destination but also, more importantly, the site of the country’s largest hydroelectric power station.Candela’s boats use hydrofoils with electric engines mounted on the bottom to effectively fly above the surface of the water once they get past a certain speed, vastly reducing energy consumption — historically and understandably a sticking point for electric boating.Candela isn’t the only one pursuing this market, either; Navier is also attempting to woo coastal communities with the draw of quiet, energy-efficient transit and is currently shuttling Stripe employees around the Bay Area.”Many legacy boating companies are embracing electric engines and next-generation tech; I spoke with the head of another major manufacturer, Brunswick’s Dave Foulkes, at CES about it."},"NBCUniversal’s Peacock will let you watch 4 livestreams at once for 2024 Paris

pressure to get it right.Image Credits: PeacockAlthough YouTube TV and Apple both offer multiview features, Peacock told TechCrunch during a briefing on Tuesday that it’s the first stand-alone

to questions TechCrunch sent Wednesday regarding the EU’s DSA enforcement in this area, a Commission spokesperson described Meta’s “subscription for no ads” (SNA) offer, as the company refers to the

immediate plans for monetization.Mermaid, the open source diagramming and charting tool, has long been popular with developers for its ability to create diagrams using a Markdown-like language.Then, in 2022, he was approached by Open Core Ventures (OCV), the venture capital firm of GitLab founder Sid Sijbrandij, which later paired him with serial entrepreneur and investor Andrew Firestone as his

disgusting":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crush1.jpg?w=1024","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/08/apples-crush-ad-is-disgusting/","content":"But in other, equally real ways, the digital transformation feels harmful and forced, a technotopian billionaire-approved vision of the future where every child has an AI best friend and can learn to play the virtual guitar on a cold glass screen.What we all understand, though, because, unlike Apple ad executives we live in the world, is that the things being crushed here represent the material, the tangible, the real.What Apple seems to have forgotten is that it is the things in the real world — the very things Apple destroyed — that give the fake versions of those things value in the first place.But the Apple ad sends the message that the future it wants doesn’t have bottles of paint, dials to turn, sculpture, physical instruments, paper books.But what Apple is doing is destroying these things to convince you that you don’t need them — all you need is the company’s little device, which can do all that and more, and no need for annoying stuff like strings, keys, buttons, brushes or mixing stations."},"Match looks to Hinge as Tinder fails":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hinge-app.jpeg?w=1024","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/08/match-looks-to-hinge-as-tinder-fails-q1-2024/","content":"CommentMatch Group, the company that owns several dating apps, including Tinder and Hinge, released its first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday, which shows that Tinder’s paying user base has decreased for the sixth quarter in a row.But its forecast for Tinder revenue in the coming quarter indicates growth will be flat or only up by 1%, at $475 million to $480 million, respectively.”“We believe the decline in ALC revenue stems from user declines and lower average purchase volumes, in part due to weaker consumer discretionary spending among its younger user base, among other reasons,” Swidler said, adding that Tinder payers are expected to decline at similar rates in the second quarter.In recent months, Tinder has worked to still grow its revenue by squeezing more money from a declining paying user base, as with the launch of a $499 per month plan for elite users.While Tinder struggles to retain paying users, Hinge is on track to become a “$1 billion revenue business,” touts CEO Bernard Kim during a conference call with investors on Wednesday morning."},"Can AI help founders fundraise more quickly and

the hood, the service is a bit more complex; so much so that Intently CEO and co-founder Slava Solonitsyn told TechCrunch that his team built Founder AI first as a services business to ensure that they understood what founders have, need and want, only to later productize that work with the help of AI.Of course, how well Founder AI does when it gets into the hands of founders will help determine how much capital Intently can raise.Some startups are working to combat the slowdown, including Intently, which is rolling out a new service this week called Founder AI.The service’s premise is simple: It will go through your personal data, understand who you know, sort those connections based on their own background in terms of what they have built and craft a few recommended paths to warm investor intros from your existing founder network.Talk about a good use of AI from a startup perspective."},"OpenAI offers a peek behind the curtain of its AI’s secret

necessary for any AI model that interacts with the general public to have a few guardrails on what it should and shouldn’t do, but defining these — let alone enforcing them — is a surprisingly difficult task.There are meta-level objectives, some hard rules and some general behavior guidelines, though to be clear these are not strictly speaking what the model is primed with; OpenAI will have developed specific instructions that accomplish what these rules describe in natural language.But what if they’re an AI developer themselves, creating a database of synthetic disinformation for a detector model?If someone asks an AI to generate a bunch of false claims about a public figure, it should refuse, right?But if that chatbot has been primed by its developer to never simply provide an answer straight out, it will instead offer to work through the solution step by step:A conversational interface might even decline to talk about anything not approved, in order to nip any manipulation attempts in the bud."},"US Patent and Trademark Office confirms another leak of filers’ address

spill in as many years.Upon discovery of the security lapse, the agency said it “blocked access to the impacted bulk data set, removed files, implemented a patch to fix the exposure, tested our solution, and re-enabled access.USPTO said that while no addresses appeared in regular searches on the agency’s website, about 14,000 applicants’ private addresses were included in bulk datasets that USPTO publishes online to aid academic and economic research.“As we’re modernizing and taking the legacy systems from the different decades of standards and protocols, the system error happened in the creation and modernization of that bulk data set.”"},"Encrypted services Apple, Proton and Wire helped Spanish police identify

friends and family to stay in touch in a more positive and personal way than is possible through traditional social media.Gratitude Plus encourages daily habits with features like push notifications and streaks, but Shaffer thinks its larger draw comes from the people you use the app with: family, friends, a partner, a child, and others who you’re interested in interacting with.He’s not alone in seeking out those sorts of tools; another startup founded by widows, DayNew, offers a social platform for people dealing with grief and trauma, for example.“A lot of people say it’s like a positive

those problems crop up, most software eventually gives up, but Video Window is designed to help solve the connection issues via their APIs and keep going, which is essential for this use case.While the concept is cool, the underlying software technology that drives it comes from Video Window, a British company that originally created software and hardware for the purpose of connecting employees in remote locations — at home or in other offices — with an always-on connection.“That Video Window has been working with very established clients including Netflix, Apple and SAP and some of the biggest companies, that also take a lot of care about data security, has also been really helpful,” he said.You don’t want people being able to take control of the connection, and Video Windows software also is helping in that regard.Video Window CEO Daryl Hutchings says that the Portal needs many of the same features as a business, with a few caveats."},"TechCrunch Minute: When did iPads

if you wanted a new iPad Pro 13-inch with cellular connectivity and a keyboard you are well in excess of the base price for a MacBook Pro.And the iPad Pro doesn’t come with a keyboard or a pencil in the box, so you often end up paying more than the price of a MacBook Air.I am writing to you on an M-based MacBook Pro right now, and it’s gosh-darn lovely.Here’s how TechCrunch reported on the matter:It’s also an expensive machine: The iPad Pro starts at $999 for the 11-inch model.New iPads with new chips and new sizes, a new Apple Pencil, and even some software updates."},"Bye-bye bots:

December 2023, Yang and Altera’s other co-founders — Andrew Ahn, Nico Christie and Shuying Luo — stepped away from their applied research lab at MIT to focus on a new goal: developing AI agents (or “AI buddies,” as Yang calls them) with “social-emotional intelligence” that can interact with players and make their own decisions in-game.The company’s first product is an AI agent that can play Minecraft with you, “just like a friend” (the waitlist to try that out is here), but this seems to be just chapter one for the company.“It has been my life goal as a neuroscientist to go all the way and build a digital human being — redefining what we thought AI was capable of,” Yang told TechCrunch.In a video demo, Yang plays around with multiple scenarios, including one where he tries to convince the AI agent to attack other people.Altera’s AI agents “execute an action as code, meaning they can play any game without material customization,” Yang explained."},"Google DeepMind debuts

why Google DeepMind is offering AlphaFold Server, a free, fully hosted web application making the model available for non-commercial use.AlphaFold 3 is not only more accurate, but predicts interactions with other biomolecules, making it a far more versatile research tool — and the company is putting a limited version of the model free to use online.While it’s difficult to overstate the excitement in this field over the last few years, researchers have largely been hamstrung by the lack of interaction modeling (of which the new version offers a form) and difficulty deploying the model.Making a free, hosted tool like this involves dedicating considerable resources to the task — make no mistake, this is a money pit, an expensive (to Google) shareware version to convince the researchers of the world that AlphaFold 3 should be, at the very least, an arrow in their quiver.I’ll let the science blogs get into exactly how the new model improves outcomes, but suffice it here to say that a variety of improvements and modeling techniques have made AlphaFold 3 not just more accurate, but more widely applicable."},"$450M for Noname, two billion-dollar rounds, and good news for

said they “initially used a mix of open source and commercial AI models”, and are now building their own “based on proprietary data for image recognition and scheduling”.The difference with Checkfirst, says Lambert, is that it is an API-first solution and uses AI for image recognition and automation, churning out report summaries, and scheduling.“The biggest problem in the industry is scheduling, and the cool thing is, with AI, you can schedule really easily,” he told me.Seeing an opportunity, Lambert founded an AI-powered workflow tools startup, Checkfirst, that, in addition to allowing for remote inspections, enables businesses to schedule inspectors based on geographical location and qualifications.“For example, an inspector could be in London today, but the company will send someone from Munich to London, because they don’t really understand they already have a guy in London."},"Controversial drone company Xtend leans into defense with new $40 million

process once more when it reaches the end of its life.In nature, fungi tend to thrive on things like dead leaves and wood, but Mycocycle’s mushrooms have been chosen for their ability to break down

demands vast investments in infrastructure and range of services that make little or no revenue, challengers like CoreWeave have an opportunity to succeed with a focus on premium AI services without the burden of hyperscaler-level investments overall,” he said.Nvidia, the furnisher of the bulk of CoreWeave’s chips, sees this as a desirable trend, perhaps for leverage reasons; it’s said to have given some alternative cloud providers preferential access to its GPUs."},"The rabbit r1 shipped half-baked, but that’s kind of the

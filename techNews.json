3 is not only more accurate, but predicts interactions with other biomolecules, making it a far more versatile research tool — and the company is putting a limited version of the model free to use online.That’s why Google Deepmind is offering AlphaFold Server, a free, fully hosted web application making the model available for non-commercial use.I’ll let the science blogs get into exactly how the new model improves outcomes, but suffice it here to say that a variety of improvements and modeling techniques have made AlphaFold 3 not just more accurate, but more widely applicable.Making a free, hosted tool like this involves dedicating considerable resources to the task — make no mistake, this is a money pit, an expensive (to Google) shareware version to convince the researchers of the world that AlphaFold 3 should be, at the very least, an arrow in their quiver.Google Deepmind has taken the wraps off a new version AlphaFold, their transformative machine learning model that predicts the shape and behavior of proteins."},"Bye-bye bots: Altera’s game-playing AI agents get backing from Eric

2023, Yang and Altera’s other co-founders—Andrew Ahn, Nico Christie, and Shuying Luo—stepped away from their applied research lab at MIT to focus on a new goal: developing AI agents (or “AI buddies,” as Yang calls them) with “social-emotional intelligence” that can interact with players and make their own decisions in-game.“It has been my life goal as a neuroscientist to go all the way and build a digital human being—redefining what we thought AI was capable of,” Yang told TechCrunch.In a video demo, Yang plays around with multiple scenarios, including one where he tries to convince the AI agent to attack other people.However, today’s AI lacks critical traits like empathy, embodiment, and personal goals, which prevent it from forming real, lasting connections with people,” Aaron Sisto, partner at First Spark Ventures, said in a statement."},"$450M for Noname, two billion-dollar rounds, and good news for crypto

Checkfirst, says Lambert, is that it is an API-first solution and uses AI for image recognition and automation, churning out report summaries, and scheduling.“The biggest problem in the industry is scheduling, and the cool thing is, with AI, you can schedule really easily,” he told me.“For example, an inspector could be in London today, but the company will send someone from Munich to London, because they don’t really understand they already have a guy in London.Seeing an opportunity, Lambert founded an AI-powered workflow tools startup, Checkfirst, that, in addition to allowing for remote inspections, enables businesses to schedule inspectors based on geographical location and qualifications."},"Controversial drone company Xtend leans into defense with new $40M

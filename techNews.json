{"Sequoia’s Jess Lee explains how early-stage startups can identify product-market

her presentation on the framework, Lee said that Sequoia does not have a favored category among the three.In sum, the theory goes like this: Startups all, more or less, fit into one of these three archetypes, so identifying which archetype a company fits in can help it focus and develop.For deep tech and moonshots — two common kinds of startups found in the “Future Vision” category — fundraising “was easier in a zero-interest-rate period when there was a ton of capital flowing in,” Lee said.Each of these archetypes will have its own customer mindset, competitive market status, opportunity/general product goals, challenges, examples of those who got it right and those that did not, and so on."},"Biden administration plans $285M in CHIPS Act funding for digital

Biden administration announced will be accepting applications for what it anticipates to be a total of $285 million in funding for work that includes research into semiconductor digital twin development, building and supporting combined physical/digital facilities, industry demonstration projects, workforce training, and operation of what it says will be a new CHIPS Manufacturing USA Institute.President Joe Biden’s administration is looking to fund efforts that improve semiconductor manufacturing by using digital twins.Echoing another major theme in the administration’s rhetoric, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Arati Prabhakar said Sunday that when the CHIPS Act was passed, semiconductor manufacturing had become “dangerously concentrated in just one part of the world” (presumably referring to China).For example, auto manufacturers are looking to use digital twins of their factories to experiment with new manufacturing processes without disrupting production."},"Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo talks about AI, chatbot platform Poe, and why OpenAI is not a

of its own while also fundraising (a $75 million round that valued it at $425 million, per PitchBook).D’Angelo said that Quora is seeing record numbers of users despite the proliferation of AI tools — although he declined to update the 400 million monthly active users figure it disclosed last July.The site surfaces the AI-written answer to some questions with a link that lets you chat with Poe if you have further questions."},"Jack Dorsey departs Bluesky

volts — up to 5,000 times the energy of visible light — with unprecedented detail.Equipped with an extraordinary array of pixels, the Resolve instrument can detect “soft” X-rays, which possess an energy approximately 5,000 times greater than visible light wavelengths."},"Alternative clouds are booming as companies seek cheaper access to

Together AI, a cloud GPU host that also conducts generative AI research, in March landed $106 million in a Salesforce-led round.“Given hyperscaler dominance of the overall public cloud market, which demands vast investments in infrastructure and range of services that make little or no revenue, challengers like CoreWeave have an opportunity to succeed with a focus on premium AI services without the burden of hypercaler-level investments overall,” he said.He believes that alternative cloud providers’ expansion will be conditioned by whether they can continue to bring GPUs online in high volume, and offer them at competitively low prices."},"The Rabbit r1 shipped half-baked, but that’s kind of the

there, Tesla had Amazon beat: The Supercharger team was told that the network was profitable, the source said, even before other automakers gained access.Tesla opened the first Supercharger station in September 2012 as the first examples of the Model S prowled the streets.On Friday, Musk said that Tesla will spend $500 million on expanding and upgrading the Supercharger network.CommentAt the start of the year, Tesla’s Supercharger team was tasked with the impossible.Tesla was previously in a strong position to win awards through the federally funded National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure

improvements to make on its technology.”Employees with equity that vested in March 2024 will not be able to be paid out immediately because Motional is still waiting on its valuation to determine the new share price, per the deck."},"OpenAI’s ChatGPT announcement: What we know so far":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Sam-Altman-OpenAI-DSC02880.jpg?w=1024","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/10/openais-chatgpt-announcement-what-we-know-so-far/","content":"According to The Information, the product will be partly powered by Bing (Microsoft is a major OpenAI investor and partner); Bloomberg said it will work as a feature within ChatGPT, allowing the chatbot to search the web and cite sources — making it less of a black box that returns answers of unknown origin.”Altman’s wording was presumably alluding to a Reuters report published earlier this week, suggesting that OpenAI plans to announce an AI-powered search product on Monday — stealing some thunder from the Google I/O developer conference, which starts Tuesday.So in theory, at least, OpenAI could announce a search feature Monday and Altman’s insistence that it’s “not a search engine” could still be true.” CEO Sam Altman, meanwhile, promoted the event with the message, “not gpt-5, not a search engine, but we’ve been hard at work on some new stuff we think people will love!”The Information and Bloomberg had previously reported that OpenAI has a search product in development."},"Meesho, an Indian social commerce platform with 150M transacting users, raises

its 2023 Environmental Performance report, SAP reported it has achieved net-zero carbon emissions across its own operations, which include heating and cooling, corporate car use, and electricity used by its buildings and data centers.To that end, she says one of the things that attracted her to SAP was its own commitment to sustainability.She also recognizes that being part of SAP is both part of the problem as a high-tech company, yet one that is also helping manage the supply chain of a majority of companies in those same systems.SAP appears to be heavily reliant on carbon offsets, in part because the majority of its emissions fall under scope 3, which covers pollution produced by the company’s products or services but lies outside the company’s control.SAP’s own experience shows how hard it is to walk the line between sustainability and profitability given the tools that are available to them and their customers."},"Why Apple’s ‘Crush’ ad is so

very possible that generative AI will one day be able to re-create scenes like this.Those are the questions I kept asking myself Wednesday at a showing of the top 10 finalists at Runway’s second annual AI Film Festival, which are available on-demand on Runway’s website as of this morning.CommentIn the third episode of “Creative Dialogues,” an interview series produced by the filmmaking division of generative AI startup Runway, multimedia artist Claire Hentschker expresses a fear that AI will commoditize the artistic process to the point where art homogenizes, regressing to a sort of derivative sameness.But a skilled directorial eye — the human touch — makes a clear difference in an “AI film’s” effectiveness.The film ends with a shot of the man walking up a bridge just as the

lot of my AI work has been in policy framing and social impact assessments, working with government departments, charities and all kinds of businesses to help them use AI and related tech in intentional and trustworthy ways.Our work made it clear that AI is not a consequence-free set of technologies but something that has diffuse real-world implications for people and societies.Continuous deployment and social adaptation mean quality assurance can’t be something that ends once a product is shipped; as AI developers, we need to build the capacity for iterative, social sensing and treat responsible development and deployment as a living process.And seek out the work of some of the great women trailblazing great AI research and practice: Start by reading the work of pioneers like Abeba Birhane, Timnit Gebru, and Joy Buolamwini, who have all produced foundational research that has shaped our understanding of how AI changes and interacts with society.The climate impacts of AI — the use of water, energy and critical minerals — and the health and social justice impacts for people and communities affected by exploitation of natural resources need to be top of the list for responsible development."},"StrictlyVC London welcomes Phoenix Court and

Layup was likely able to close a large funding round so quickly at least in part because the founders themselves have deep experience with the issues that plague domestic manufacturing.The bulk of the work ahead for the company, and where it will most strongly be able to differentiate itself, is in the software domain, though it will likely be a few years until Layup can accept any CAD model from customers and deliver a part in a matter of days.Instead, Layup aims to return small parts in three days, and for larger components, the company targets two weeks — all at a lower cost to the customer.CommentScarcely five months after its founding, hard tech startup Layup Parts has landed a $9 million round of financing led by Founders Fund to transform composites manufacturing.But that doesn’t mean the company isn’t moving fast: With the new funding, Layup aims to have a factory online making parts for customers by the end of the third quarter of this year."},"Startups Weekly:

I know this is our startups weekly newsletter, and as the most valuable company in the world, Apple is kind of the ultimate “not a startup,” but judging by the traffic on the site, y’all are such rabid fans that it seems rude not to do a quick roundup: Apple ran a short, 40-ish minute event this week, where it showed off new iPad Airs, new iPad Pros (with a fancy new stacked screen technology), a new Magic Keyboard, a new Pencil Pro, brand-new M4 chips, and much more.Iconiq Capital, the private office that’s been babysitting Mark Zuckerberg’s and Jack Dorsey’s cash piles since 2011, has just raised a whopping $5 billion across two funds for its seventh flagship fund.It seems it isn’t just a one-off: It’s more like an episode of “Judge Judy” with over 30 lawsuits alleging lemon law violations, claims for unpaid wages from former employees and suppliers suing for overdue bills.Lacey Hunter thought she’d hit the jackpot with her AI humanitarian aid startup TechAid when

UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) late last year pushed for governments to regulate the use of generative AI in education, including implementing age limits for users and guardrails on data protection and user privacy.CommentAI startup Anthropic is changing its policies to allow minors to use its generative AI systems — in certain circumstances, at least.In a support article, Anthropic lists several safety measures devs creating AI-powered apps for minors should include, like age verification systems, content moderation and filtering and educational resources on “safe and responsible” AI use for minors.Anthropic’s change in policy comes as kids and teens are increasingly turning to generative AI tools for help not only with schoolwork but personal issues, and as rival generative AI vendors — including Google and OpenAI — are exploring more use cases aimed at children.Announced in a post on the company’s official blog Friday, Anthropic will begin letting teens and preteens use third-party apps (but not its own apps, necessarily) powered by its AI models so long as the developers of those apps implement specific safety features and disclose to users which Anthropic technologies they’re leveraging."},"The buzziest EV IPO of the year is a Chinese

pension fund made 15 commitments to venture funds in 2023 and has made two commitments so far this year, including a $75 million commitment into IVP XVIII and a $40 million commitment to Volition Capital Fund V.So while venture funds don’t seem on the path to knock it out of the park this year in terms of performance, the worst of the downturn’s effects may already be behind us.For example, the pension fund has invested more than $273 million into Notable Capital, $250 million in NEA funds and $69 million in Mayfield in the last decade, among many others.While they don’t tell us about each fund’s individual performance, or how funds nearing maturity are doing specifically, these numbers do tell us that overall fund performance is down."},"Threat actor says he scraped 49M Dell

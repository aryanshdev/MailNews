disgusting":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crush1.jpg?w=1024","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/09/apples-crush-ad-is-disgusting/","content":"What we all understand, though — because unlike Apple ad executives, we live in the world — is that the things being crushed here represent the material, the tangible, the real.But the Apple ad sends the message that the future it wants doesn’t have bottles of paint, dials to turn, sculpture, physical instruments, paper books.What Apple seems to have forgotten is that it is the things in the real world — the very things Apple destroyed — that give the fake versions of those things value in the first place.But what Apple is doing is destroying these things to convince you that you don’t need them — all you need is the company’s little device, which can do all that and more, and no need for annoying stuff like strings, keys, buttons, brushes or mixing stations.But in other, equally real ways, the digital transformation feels harmful and forced, a technotopian billionaire-approved vision of the future where every child has an AI best friend and can learn to play the virtual guitar on a cold glass screen."},"Google built some of the first social apps for Android, including Twitter and

a tidbit of startup history that may not be widely known outside of the tech firms themselves: The first versions of popular Android apps, like Twitter, were built by Google itself.In fact, Google had detailed its work on the Android Twitter client in a 2010 blog post, but much of the press coverage at the time didn’t credit the app to Google’s work, making this a forgotten bit of internet history.In Google’s post, the company explains how they implemented early Android best practices within the Twitter app.For instance, she worked on Twitter’s video app, Vine, (after returning to Twitter from a stint at Secret), and had been under pressure to launch Vine on Android before Instagram launched its video product.Twitter then took the Android app that Google built and continued to develop it."},"Plinky is an app for you to collect and organize links

long-term, Fabisevich wants to build more personalized workflows to save and prioritize links, along with a better search experience.However, Raindrop doesn’t play well with YouTube and App Store

number of links and bookmarks.He wants to make it easy for people to import links from existing services like GoodLinks, Raindrop, and Pocket, where they might already have a library of bookmarks and clippings.Plinky offers a much better solution than saving links through a browser’s bookmark manager, given that it’s easier to organize links in the app with folders and labels."},"WhatsApp’s latest

pair, who have been friends since college, decided to build Triomics in 2021 after realizing that advances in generative AI and LLMs could help extract data from electronic health records (EHR)  to help find appropriate clinical trials for cancer patients in minutes instead of hours.And just in March, I spent half a Saturday trying to find a clinical trial for a friend who has stage IV cancer.After Triomics’ LLM, which the company is calling OncoLLM, “reads” the patient’s medical record, the data could be used to help prepare doctors and other medical staff for patient visits or to help submit cancer data with details of organs affected and stage of progressions to state regulatory agencies.Medical staff often need hours to manually review a patient’s medical record to find a fitting clinical trial.Since most clinical trials have complex criteria, there are often dozens of factors such as stage of cancer, mutations and previous treatments for eligibility."},"Tesla drives

non-public content like private messages or non-public account information, like users’ emails or browsing history, among other things."}}

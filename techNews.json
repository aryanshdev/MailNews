Lees, a lawyer from the firm Milbank who represents a group of unsecured creditors owed more than $600 million, said in the proceeding’s first hearing on Friday in Delaware Bankruptcy Court that it took “too long” to get to this point.CommentFisker is just a few days into its Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and the fight over its assets is already charged, with one lawyer claiming the startup has been liquidating assets “outside the court’s supervision.He added later that even if Fisker is able to sell its entire remaining inventory — around 4,300 Ocean SUVs — such a sale “will maybe pay off a fraction of Heights’ secured debt,” which currently sits at more than $180 million.Heights not only gained pole position to determine what happens to the assets in the Chapter 11 proceedings, but also gave them the chance to tap a preferred restructuring officer to oversee the company’s slow descent into bankruptcy.Heights loaned Fisker more than $500 million in 2023 (with the option to convert that debt to stock in the startup) at a time when the company’s financial distress was looming behind the scenes."},"The fall of EV startup Fisker: A comprehensive

hurdle to getting robotaxis back on roads in California":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1189070702.jpg?w=1024","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/21/cruise-clears-key-hurdle-to-getting-robotaxis-back-on-roads-in-california/","content":"“We conclude that by taking these corrective measures, Cruise is on its way to restoring public trust by making itself a more transparent and cooperative entity that will not hide material information from regulatory agencies who oversee its AV transportation services,” reads the ruling.The settlement with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) not only avoids litigation, it puts Cruise in a position to restart operations in the state.But Cruise still has an active permit with the DMV to test its vehicles with a safety driver, something the company might lean on as it attempts to close its last chapter and move forward.The settlement agreement “bring[s] this dispute to a close” allowing the Commission staff to “devote their resources to Cruise’s regulatory oversight rather than engage in potentially protracted litigation,” reads the ruling.The robotaxi then dragged the pedestrian 20 feet as it was attempting a pullover maneuver, a fact that Cruise staff didn’t immediately share with the CPUC and other state and federal regulators when they probed the company."},"Change Healthcare confirms ransomware hackers stole medical records on a ‘substantial

Store description explains.In this way, the team thinks that Dot can actually help prime users for the experience of human connection by getting people comfortable in opening up.Though Dot’s creators say the chatbot will ultimately urge you to talk to a mental health professional if you delve into “heavier” topics, one could imagine people spending increased time pouring out their emotions to Dot as they get used to the experience.When you nudge Dot to drop this train of thought — it’s just an aspirational dream, after all — the AI immediately shifts to asking you about “your biggest priority

Sussman, who was one of the four co-founders of unicorn-size mental health network Headway, believes his new startup can help address the deepening crisis by offering online group therapy for children in grades five through 12.Sussman realized that one way to solve the mental health professional shortage is to offer help in a group setting.”Marble, which Sussman started late last year with another Headway co-founder, Dan Ross, claims it can solve the logistics of organizing group treatment and, at the same time, help many more students without sacrificing quality of care.”  While studies found that group therapy is as effective as individual therapy, this type of treatment is not often offered by mental health professionals.“If you have two groups, and one is just 17-year-old girls who have anxiety and another is 17-year-old girls who have anxiety and are Hispanic, and identify as LGBTQ, that second group, all things equal, is going to be much, much more effective because it’s more specific,” Sussman said."},"A new startup from Figure’s founder is licensing NASA tech in a bid to curb school

building platform Squarespace is selling Tock, its restaurant reservation service, to American Express in a deal worth $400 million — the exact figure that Squarespace paid for the service three years ago.That Squarespace is divesting Tock before its own acquisition is concluded suggests that it sees Tock as surplus to requirements regardless of the outcome, and an extra $400 million in the bank will enable it to get back to its roots as a website builder for SMBs, while investing in other complementary tools such as online payments for e-commerce firms.TechCrunch has reached out both to Permira and Squarespace to get further insights on the rationale behind this sale, and will update when we hear back.The move was somewhat synergistic to its main website building offering, insofar as Square could offer restaurant customers a way not only to develop their online visibility, but then build further services around that.Squarespace acquired Tock in 2021 for $400 million, shortly before going public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)."},"Google pauses its experiment to expand real-money games on the Play

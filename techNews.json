high cost of commercializing a robotaxi business and the long road ahead to profits.Motional has pushed its plan to launch a commercial driverless robotaxi service — meaning no human safety operator

launched its first spacecraft, called Otter Pup, nearly a year ago with ambitious plans to use it to rendezvous and dock with another satellite on orbit.Starfish Space’s ambitious first mission to demonstrate on-orbit rendezvous and docking tech has officially come to a close, with the startup managing to complete some of the objectives thanks to a little help from an unexpected partner: space logistics company D-Orbit.Starfish Space pulls Otter Pup servicing vehicle back from ‘the brink of death’That’s no easy task: they had to find an operational spacecraft with no conflicting mission objectives, and that had the requisite delta-V — that is, enough onboard propulsion — to maneuver close enough to Otter Pup.Starfish and D-Orbit faced additional challenges given that Otter Pup’s thrusters were dead, and the two companies are headquartered, respectively, in Washington state and Italy.Although Otter Pup was unable to attempt docking, Link and Starfish co-founder Trevor Bennett both emphasized that the mission fueled the team with plentiful valuable data to inform future missions."},"Legion’s founder aims to close the gap between what employers and workers

from last year.Besides the company’s fast growth, what attracted Zeev to Honeycomb is that landlord insurance is a “sleepy” industry ready for innovation, but also the sector is not large enough for insurance giants to want to tackle it.“We are planning to go beyond landlord insurance,” Ben Zaken said, adding that his company’s goal is to be a one-stop shop for commercial real estate

as Makro and Bob Group’s bidorbuy to tap what is estimated to be e-commerce revenue worth $3 billion annually.South Africa is however a very specific market, different from most African countries,

coming: Amazon had first said it would launch on the continent two years ago, in two countries, Nigeria and South Africa.That in itself appeared to be building on Amazon putting South Africa and the

2-year-old all-in-one financial management platform, which offers businesses its first three cards for free, generates revenue from interchange fees, floats and FX markups.This surge in card usage, about 14% in the last four years, is primarily due to the incentives introduced by fintech companies and banks, attracting millions of Egyptian consumers who previously relied mainly on cash for their transactions.Yet, there are significant tailwinds from a regulatory perspective; for instance, Egypt’s apex bank, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), launched initiatives such as the Instant Payment Network (IPN) to reduce cash-based transactions and encourage digital payments.Cards are gaining ground in Egypt, with over 30 million in circulation (prepaid cards, particularly, are seeing more use

a consensus” that regulation was needed to better combat the spread of deepfake videos as well as apps that facilitate their creation.The Election Commission said on Monday it has been “repeatedly directing” the political parties and their leaders to “maintain decorum and utmost restraint in public campaigning.Prime Minister Narendra Modi complained late last month about the use of fake voices to purportedly show leaders making statements they had “never even thought of,” alleging that this was part of a conspiracy designed to sow tension in society."}}

{"Google DeepMind debuts huge AlphaFold update and free proteomics-as-a-service web app":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/alphafold-3-deepmind.webp?w=1024","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/08/google-deepmind-debuts-huge-alphafold-update-and-free-proteomics-as-a-service-web-app/","content":"That’s why Google DeepMind is offering AlphaFold Server, a free, fully hosted web application making the model available for non-commercial use.AlphaFold 3 is not only more accurate, but predicts interactions with other biomolecules, making it a far more versatile research tool — and the company is putting a limited version of the model free to use online.I’ll let the science blogs get into exactly how the new model improves outcomes, but suffice it here to say that a variety of improvements and modeling techniques have made AlphaFold 3 not just more accurate, but more widely applicable.While it’s difficult to overstate the excitement in this field over the last few years, researchers have largely been hamstrung by the lack of interaction modeling (of which the new version offers a form) and difficulty deploying the model.Making a free, hosted tool like this involves dedicating considerable resources to the task — make no mistake, this is a money pit, an expensive (to Google) shareware version to convince the researchers of the world that AlphaFold 3 should be, at the very least, an arrow in their quiver."},"Machine learning aids in discovery of sperm whale ‘alphabet’":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-114809316.jpg?w=1024","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/07/machine-learning-aids-in-discovery-of-sperm-whale-alphabet/","content":"The paper adds:Our results demonstrate that sperm whale vocalizations form a complex combinatorial communication system: the seemingly arbitrary inventory of coda types can be explained by combinations of rhythm, tempo, rubato, and ornamentation features.Results from the study, which were published under the title, “Contextual and Combinatorial Structure in Sperm Whale Vocalizations,” point to key breakthroughs in our understanding of cetacean communication.“However, almost everything else about the sperm whale communication system, including basic questions about its structure and information-carrying capacity, remains unknown.”CommentResearchers at MIT CSAIL and Project CETI believe that they have unlocked a kind of sperm whale alphabet with the aid of machine learning technologies.The paper notes that previous research has noted 150 different sperm whale codas."},"Mycocycle uses mushrooms to upcycle old tires and construction waste":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1350655821.jpeg?w=1024","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/08/mycocycle-uses-mushrooms-to-upcycle-old-tires-and-construction-waste/","content":"Rodriguez said that Mycocycle’s fungi can work on a wide range of waste, including paper, rubber and nylon.The startup delivered one of its bio-processors to a nearby dumpster company, which crushed the drywall and dumped it into the processor along with the fungi from Mycocycle.The fungi don’t consume all the rubber, but rather encases it in a web of mycelia, all of which Rodriguez said Mycocycle can process once more when it reaches the end of its life.In nature, fungi tend to thrive on things like dead leaves and wood, but Mycocycle’s mushrooms have been chosen for their ability to break down materials produced using oil and gas.Rodriguez is the founder and CEO of Mycocycle, one of a fresh crop of startups using fungi, nature’s recyclers, to create plastic-like polymers for a post-fossil fuel economy."},"Ofcom to push for better age verification, filters and 40 other checks in new online child safety

as the Children’s Safety Code, its guidance for services includes a draft Children’s Register of Risk, which it said sets out more information on how risks of harm to children manifest online; and draft Harms Guidance which sets out examples and the kind of content it considers to be harmful to children.”The regulator recently announced plans to launch an additional consultation later this year which it said will look at how automated tools, aka AI technologies, could be deployed to content moderation processes to proactively detect illegal content and content most harmful to children — such as previously undetected CSAM and content encouraging suicide and self-harm.“In practice, this means that all services which do not ban harmful content, and those at higher risk of it being shared on their service, will be expected to implement highly effective age-checks to prevent children from seeing it,” it added in a press release Monday.” Under the draft Code, any service that operates a recommender system — a form of algorithmic content sorting, tracking user activity — and is at “higher risk” of showing harmful content, must use “highly-effective” age assurance to identify who their child users are.Ofcom previously named child safety as its first priority in enforcing the UK’s Online Safety Act — a sweeping content moderation and governance rulebook that touches on harms as diverse as online fraud and scam ads; cyberflashing and deepfake revenge porn; animal cruelty; and cyberbullying and trolling, as well as regulating how services tackle illegal content like terrorism and child sexual abuse material (CSAM)."},"WhatsApp’s latest update streamlines navigation and adds a ‘darker dark

others":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gettyimages-502130278.jpg?w=1024","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/09/google-built-some-of-the-first-social-apps-for-android-including-twitter-and-others/","content":"In fact, Google had detailed its work on the Android Twitter client in a 2010 blog post, but much of the press coverage at the time didn’t credit the app to Google’s work, making this a forgotten bit of internet history.CommentHere’s a tidbit of startup history that may not be widely known outside of the tech firms themselves: The first versions of popular Android apps, like Twitter, were built by Google itself.For instance, she worked on Twitter’s video app, Vine, (after returning to Twitter from a stint at Secret), and had been under pressure to launch Vine on Android before Instagram launched its video product.At Twitter, Beykpour had led the shutdown of Vine’s product — an app still so well-liked that even new Twitter/X owner Elon Musk keeps teasing bringing it back.Twitter then took the Android app that Google had built and continued to develop it."},"Plinky is an app for you to collect and organize links

pair, who have been friends since college, decided to build Triomics in 2021 after realizing that advances in generative AI and LLMs could help extract data from electronic health records (EHR)  to help find appropriate clinical trials for cancer patients in minutes instead of hours.After Triomics’ LLM, which the company is calling OncoLLM, “reads” the patient’s medical record, the data could be used to help prepare doctors and other medical staff for patient visits or to help submit cancer data with details of organs affected and stage of progressions to state regulatory agencies.And just in March, I spent half a Saturday trying to find a clinical trial for a friend who has stage IV cancer.Medical staff often need hours to manually review a patient’s medical record to find a fitting clinical trial.But I unfortunately know from personal experience how hard it is to find clinical trials for cancer patients."},"Tesla drives Luminar lidar sales and Motional pauses robotaxi

data":{"img":null,"link":"https://techcrunch.com/video/techcrunch-minute-openai-will-soon-ask-to-use-your-content-as-training-data/","content":"But OpenAI is making its position clear over time, starting to pay more folks and even, TechCrunch reports, building a tool called Media Manager that will allow creators to better control how their content is being used to train generative AI models by giving them the option to opt out.CommentThe intersection of AI and copyright-protected material is a fraught place.There you can find lawsuits, deals, acrimony, and even various flavors of the personal-political leading folks to either demand — or dismiss — the idea that training material for AI models deserves to be paid for.That’s a welcome concept, albeit one that many consider a bit late given that OpenAI used lots of copyright-protected media to train its models to-date — and it’s facing copyright lawsuits from The New York Times and other U.The goal is to have the new tool in place and ready to use by 2025."}}

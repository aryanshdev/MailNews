I/O developer conference, which starts Tuesday.According to The Information, the product will be partly powered by Bing (Microsoft is a major OpenAI investor and partner); Bloomberg said it will work as a feature within ChatGPT, allowing the chatbot to search the web and cite sources — making it less of a black box that returns answers of unknown origin.So in theory, at least, OpenAI could announce a search feature Monday and Altman’s insistence that it’s “not a search engine” could still be true.” CEO Sam Altman, meanwhile, promoted the event with the message, “not gpt-5, not a search engine, but we’ve been hard at work on some new stuff we think people will love!”The Information and Bloomberg had previously reported that OpenAI has a search product in development."},"Anthropic now

necessarily) powered by its AI models so long as the developers of those apps implement specific safety features and disclose to users which Anthropic technologies they’re leveraging.In a support article, Anthropic lists several safety measures devs creating AI-powered apps for minors should include, like age verification systems, content moderation and filtering and educational resources on “safe and responsible” AI use for minors.CommentAI startup Anthropic is changing its policies to allow minors to use its generative AI systems — in certain circumstances, at least.Anthropic’s change in policy comes as kids and teens are increasingly turning to generative AI tools for help not only with schoolwork but personal issues, and as rival generative AI vendors — including Google and

Layup was likely able to close a large funding round so quickly at least in part because the founders themselves have deep experience with the issues that plague domestic manufacturing.The bulk of the work ahead for the company, and where it will most strongly be able to differentiate itself, is in the software domain, though it will likely be a few years until Layup can accept any CAD model from customers and deliver a part in a matter of days.Instead, Layup aims to return small parts in three days, and for larger components, the company targets two weeks — all at a lower cost to the customer.CommentScarcely five months after its founding, hard tech startup Layup Parts has landed a $9 million round of financing led by Founders Fund to transform composites manufacturing.But that

technology), a new Magic Keyboard, a new Pencil Pro, brand-new M4 chips, and much more.Iconiq Capital, the private office that’s been babysitting Mark Zuckerberg’s and Jack Dorsey’s cash piles since 2011, has just raised a whopping $5 billion across two funds for its seventh flagship fund.It seems it isn’t just a one-off: It’s more like an episode of “Judge Judy” with over 30 lawsuits alleging

don’t tell us about each fund’s individual performance, or how funds nearing maturity are doing specifically, these numbers do tell us that overall fund performance is down.For example, the pension fund has invested more than $273 million into Notable Capital, $250 million in NEA funds and $69 million in Mayfield in the last decade, among many others."},"TechCrunch Minute: Hinge is taking

egg is the new 2025 Honda CR-V e:FCEV — a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle I spent the day driving and that will soon be available for lease in California.Just like battery-electric cars 20 years ago, hydrogen fuel cell cars suffer from the old chicken and the egg problem.Yep, this CR-V is a plug-in hybrid that replaces the internal combustion engine with a hydrogen fuel cell.Here we are some eight years later and Honda is putting a hydrogen fuel cell into its popular CR-V crossover, but with a bit of a twist.The company says it will sell only zero-emission vehicles by 2040 with a fleet of battery electric and fuel cell vehicles."},"Linktree is now allowing users to highlight links better with featured layout

a husband and wife founding team with three young children, it’s not easy to maintain a work-life balance, but Young says she and her husband carve out work time and family time and try not to let one bleed into the other to maintain the proper focus for both the family and the company.“We felt very strongly about simulations being the future of business, and I think we were just waiting for someone to build it – and then suddenly, it’s 2020 — and our time got freed up because we left Autodesk.TigerEye CEO Tracy Young and her husband and CTO Ralph Gootee helped build their previous startup, PlanGrid, into a $100 million ARR business before selling it to Autodesk for $875 million in 2018.She says during the day when they’re at work, they have others who are responsible for the kids, but at night the couple fiercely protects dinner time as family time.“TigerEye is a business simulation engine that helps companies predict their future,” Young told TechCrunch."},"Final chance

Meta’s social networks privately without charge is not currently an option in the EU despite the adtech giant (briefly) allowing regional users who exercised a right to object to its tracking to opt out of use of their data for ads last year — when it was claiming a so-called “legitimate interest” (LI) for ads processing, after its earlier claim (contractual necessity) was found to breach data protection rules in January 2023.Critics say Meta’s approach relies upon economic coercion to manipulate users to accept tracking, arguing it does not comply with the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — which requires consent to be freely given.However the consent mechanism it devised is controversial because it offers users a Hobson’s Choice of paying it money to access the mainstream social networks or continuing to get free access but with tracking.The ex ante market power regulation puts limits on how gatekeepers can use people’s data for ads — requiring they obtain explicit consent.The Court of Justice of the EU went on to dismantle Meta’s ability to claim a LI for the processing in a ruling last summer — after which Meta said it would shift to consent."},"Who needs free shipping? Delivery startup Ingrid banks $23M to provide a viable alternative":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-19-at-09.32.54.png?w=534","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/19/ingrid-receives-23m-to-expand-an-e-commerce-delivery-platform-that-snubs-free-shipping/","content":"So, while a delivery platform might potentially consider a product that effectively builds an Amazon Prime-style competitor for retailers that want to offer those benefits but want to avoid paying fees to Amazon, or losing critical customer ownership in the process, Zaleski said that Ingrid will not be the one to build it.So, while the company has now an impressive 20% share of the consumer market in its home country of Sweden — which Zaleski spelled out to me as “more than 15% of consumers” shopping online will use Ingrid in one way or another — and while that will serve it to grow well in the years to come judging by the acceleration of the business now; it spells more challenges when Ingrid wants to break into totally new markets.Turning back to Ingrid the startup, the company’s basic understanding is that for any retailer that is not Amazon, fulfilment and logistics are not the core of what they do, and for those whose speciality is delivery, they are not experts in e-commerce, so providing a service that can stitch these together better will be useful to both.That is one reason why Prime and Amazon continue to kill it in the market, and why they have forced the hand of so many others to figure out how also to provide “free shipping.Using data science and some big ideas about how delivery will evolve in the years ahead — it thinks we should move away from free shipping — the company is on an ambitious track to expand to more markets in Europe."},"Uber leads $100M investment in African mobility fintech Moove as valuation hits

an African mobility fintech that offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers, has raised $100 million in a funding round as it plots expansion into new markets.Moove did not say who is leading the round, but sources close to the deal confirmed to TechCrunch that Uber led the Series B round, making it the company’s first investment in the African continent.Moove says it plans to use the new capital to expand its revenue-based vehicle financing platform to 16 markets by the end of 2025.Though drivers join Moove to find a source of income, these macroeconomic conditions have placed significant strain on them, leading some to protest that the working arrangements with the vehicle financing platform (particularly regarding the weekly remittance to the platform) add more stress than relief.Uber’s decision to back Moove, marking its first investment in an Africa-founded startup, suggests a concerted effort to ensure a steady supply of drivers for its ride-hailing

shadowbanning":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-pattern.jpg?w=711","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/18/x-shadowban-complaints/","content":"Users of Elon Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) continue complaining the platform is engaging in shadowbanning — aka restricting the visibility of posts by applying a “temporary” label to accounts that can limit the reach/visibility of content — without providing clarity over why it’s imposed the sanctions.It’s also notable that even X’s own boilerplate notification doesn’t explicitly accuse restricted users of being spammers; it just says there “may” be spam on their accounts or some (unspecified) form of platform manipulation going on (which, in the latter case, walks further away from the Article 17 exemption, unless it’s also platform manipulated related to “deceptive high-volume commercial content”, which would surely fit under the spam reason so why even bother mentioning platform manipulation?Edwards points out that Article 17 of the pan-EU law requires X to provide a “clear and specific statement of reasons to any affected recipients for any restriction of the visibility of specific items of information” — with the law broadly draft to cover “any restrictions” on the visibility of the user’s content; any removal of their content; the disabling of access to content or demoting content.X is also under pressure from DSA enforcers to purge illegal content off its platform — which is an area of specific focus for the Commission probe — so perhaps, and we’re speculating here, it’s doing the equivalent of flicking a bunch of content visibility levers in a bid to shrink other types of content risks — but leaving itself open to charges of failing its DSA transparency obligations in the process.“As you know, we have sent Requests for Information [to X] and, on December 18, 2023, opened formal proceedings into X concerning, among other things, the platform’s content moderation and platform manipulation policies,” the Commission spokesperson also told us, adding: “The current investigation covers Articles 34(1), 34(2) and 35(1), 16(5) and 16(6), 25(1), 39 and

production environments.Nvidia is already working with Amazon, Google and Microsoft to make these NIM microservices available on SageMaker, Kubernetes Engine and Azure AI, respectively.With NIM, Nvidia clearly aims to create an ecosystem of AI-ready containers that use its hardware as the foundational layer with these curated microservices as the core software layer for companies that want to speed up their AI roadmap.NIM takes the software work Nvidia has done around inferencing and optimizing models and makes it easily accessible by combining a given model with an optimized inferencing engine and then packing this into a container, making that accessible as a microservice."},"Nvidia enlists humanoid robotics’ biggest names for new AI platform,

with the aid of internal company documents and conversations with sources, I learned that SpaceX requires employees to agree to some unusual terms related to their stock awards, which have a chilling

notable that even X’s own boilerplate notification doesn’t explicitly accuse restricted users of being spammers; it just says there “may” be spam on their accounts or some (unspecified) form of platform manipulation going on (which, in the latter case, walks further away from the Article 17 exemption, unless it’s also platform manipulated related to “deceptive high-volume commercial content”, which would surely fit under the spam reason so why even bother mentioning platform manipulation?Users of Elon Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) continue complaining the platform is engaging in shadowbanning — aka restricting the visibility of posts by applying a “temporary” label to accounts that can limit the reach/visibility of content — without providing clarity over why it’s imposed the sanctions.Edwards points out that Article 17 of the pan-EU law requires X to provide a “clear and specific statement of reasons to any affected recipients for any restriction of the visibility of specific items of information” — with the law broadly draft to cover “any restrictions” on the visibility of the user’s content; any removal of their content; the disabling of access to content or demoting content.Running a search on X for the phrase “temporary label” shows multiple instances of users complaining about being told they’ve been flagged by the platform; and, per an automated notification, that the reach of their content “may” be affected.Musk says X will address shadowbanning ‘soon,’ but former Trust & Safety exec explains why that will be difficultElon Musk’s X faces

the closest to “open source” an AI model can be is when its developers release its weights, which is to say the exact attributes of the countless nodes of its neural networks, which perform vector mathematics operations in precise order to complete the pattern started by a user’s input.If they are really dedicated to open source development, this will be the first of many releases, and they will hopefully take the feedback of the community into account, release other crucial information, characterize the training data process, and further explain their approach.Elon Musk’s xAI released

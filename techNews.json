{"LinkedIn plans to add gaming to its

to boost the time people are spending on the platform, the company is breaking into a totally new area: gaming.Over the years, LinkedIn has tried out a number of different new features over the years to boost how and how much people use its platform, with the strategy possibly best described as: “how can we take the most popular tools people are using right now and make them relevant to LinkedIn’s audience and focus on the world of work?com/hLITqc8aqw— Nima Owji (@nima_owji) March 16, 2024A spokesperson for LinkedIn has confirmed that it is working on gaming, but said there is as yet no launch date.LinkedIn, the Microsoft-owned social platform, has made a name for itself primarily as a platform for people looking to network and pick up knowledge for professional purposes, and for recruitment — a business that now has more 1 billion users.But in 2022 it shut down its standalone gaming app amid a decline in usage: it’s putting significantly more focus these days on mixed reality experiences and its Meta Quest business."},"SpaceX doc leaks, TikTok ban gains steam, and Grok to go

AI":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Aaron-Levie.jpeg?w=599","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/16/aaron-levie-box-workflow-automation-ai/","content":"But what Box is doing with Crooze and generative AI may be part of a larger content management industry shift, one that could be as important as the move from on-prem to the cloud that Box helped lead 15 years ago.”Box is hardly alone in this push, but as generative AI advances the ability to generate content and query the content store, we are starting to see content management and knowledge management (business memory) merging together.Cheryl McKinnon, a Forrester analyst who has been covering content for management for two decades, says she sees the content management industry as whole moving in the same direction as Box, and she believes it is a natural progression.The way to think about it is that for the first time ever within Box, you’re going to be able to build no-code applications that let you render your content for any business process that you want,” Levie told TechCrunch.Just having content sitting in storage repositories isn’t enough anymore, and AI is driving the push to automate workflows and produce practical business productivity outcomes."},"AI is keeping GitHub chief legal officer Shelley McKinley busy":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2023-11-09_GitHub_Universe_0478_6c2d7f-e1710576548561.jpg?w=712","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/16/ai-is-keeping-github-chief-legal-officer-shelley-mckinley-busy/","content":"So in effect, developers behind open source general purpose AI models don’t have to provide the same level of documentation and guarantees to EU regulators — though it’s not yet clear which proprietary and open-source models will fall under its “high-risk” categorization.”GitHub CEO on why open source developers should be exempt from the EU’s AI ActAs things transpired, the text of the AI Act now includes some exemptions for AI models and systems released under free and open-source licenses — though a notable exception includes where “unacceptable” high-risk AI systems are at play.And this is why GitHub has been so vociferous about the AI Act, lobbying for exemptions for developers working on open source general purpose AI technology.The advance of AI has also been heavily dependent on open source, with collaboration and shared data pivotal to some of the most preeminent AI systems today — this is perhaps best exemplified by the generative AI poster child OpenAI, which began with a strong open-source foundation before abandoning those roots for a more proprietary play (this pivot is also one of the reasons Elon Musk is currently suing OpenAI).But those intricacies aside, McKinley reckons that their hard lobbying work has mostly paid off, with regulators placing less focus on software “componentry” (the individual elements of a system that open-source developers are more likely to create), and more on what’s happening at the compiled application level."},"This Week in AI: Midjourney bets it can beat the copyright

the change can also be taken as a sign of Midjourney’s conviction that AI vendors like itself will emerge victorious in the courtroom battles with creators whose works comprise vendors’ training data.Google Deepmind wants your co-op gaming partner to be their AI: Training an agent on many hours of 3D game play made it capable of performing simple tasks phrased in natural language.Last week, Midjourney, the AI startup building image (and soon video) generators, made a small, blink-and-you’ll-miss-it change to its terms of service related to the company’s policy around IP disputes.Should the justice system decide fair use applies, nothing’s stopping the startup from continuing as it has been, scraping and training on copyrighted data old and new.The large datasets and lack of time to sift through them made the topic a natural target for AI, which resulted in this unexpected reversal."},"Gumroad no longer allows most NSFW art, leaving its adult creators

2021, OnlyFans announced it would no longer host adult content, which was baffling, since the site is almost synonymous with sex (OnlyFans has tried to push its safe-for-work offerings, with little success).The site saw so much pushback that it reversed course; now, OnlyFans is able to accept credit card payments from Visa/Mastercard since it complies with the payment processor’s recent, more rigorous adult content policies.Patreon also updated its adult content guidelines this week to more precisely define what is allowed on the site.Adult creators are taught to anticipate this kind of deplatforming; it’s happened on Patreon, which used to be much more lax about NSFW content, and it almost happened on OnlyFans.Almost all other services charge a hefty monthly fee and have terms of service that already disallow adult content."},"Starbucks ditches its Odyssey NFT

Ministry of Electronics and IT shared an updated AI advisory with industry stakeholders on Friday that no longer asked them to take the government approval before launching or deploying an AI model to users in the South Asian market.”The March 1 advisory also marked a reversal of India’s previous hands-off approach to AI regulation.India is walking back on a recent AI advisory after receiving criticism from many local and global entrepreneurs and investors.The ministry said earlier this month that though the advisory wasn’t legally binding, it signals that it’s the “future of regulation” and that the government required compliance.The advisory emphasizes that AI models should not be used to share unlawful content under Indian law and should not permit bias, discrimination, or threats to the integrity of the electoral process."},"Leaked SpaceX documents show company forbids employees to sell stock if it deems they’ve misbehaved":{"img":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/musk-spacex-employee-stock.jpg?w=711","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/15/spacex-employee-stock-sales-forbidden/","content":"The document also states that there is a risk that there may never be a public market for the company’s common stock — an issue should an employee ever be barred from tender events.These terms “keep everyone under their control, even if they have left the company,” one former employee said, because employees don’t want to be forced to return their valuable SpaceX stock for no compensation.It’s not uncommon for additional terms to be attached to employee stock compensation at startups, and employees who stay with the company long enough to vest stock may have acquired stock under various stock plans with various conditions.Unlike stock in public companies, stock in private companies cannot be sold without the company’s permission.If SpaceX bars an employee from selling stock in the tender offers, the person would have to wait until SpaceX goes public to realize cash from the shares — and it’s unclear when that will happen, if it ever does."},"Pornhub says, ‘Bad Texas!

vehicle technology startup Motional has secured a bridge loan that provides a temporary financial reprieve as the company searches for a longer-term source of funding, TechCrunch has learned.That left Motional, which plans to launch a commercial robotaxi service in 2024, with enough capital runway to last through the end of Q1 2024, according to sources familiar with internal meetings at the time.After a wave of consolidation and shutdowns in the nascent autonomous vehicle industry, Motional is one of the few companies left that’s still pursuing a commercial robotaxi service.He later added that the bridge financing “will allow our shareholders additional time to discuss longer term funding options and solidify alignment on Motional’s strategic direction.Motional CEO Karl Iagnemma told staff in a companywide email viewed by TechCrunch that the company’s board of directors approved the bridge financing."},"How to verify a data

into 23andMe’s network and “dumped” a copy of 23andMe’s user database directly from its servers, the data would likely present itself in a different format and contain additional information about the server that the data was stored on.The messages we sent to StockX victims included who we were (“I’m a reporter at TechCrunch”), and the reason why we were reaching out (“We found your information in an as-yet-unreported data breach and need your help to verify its authenticity so we can notify the company and other victims”).The key thing here is that the two sets of data were formatted somewhat differently, but contained enough of the same unique user information — including the user account hashes and matching genetic data — to suggest that the data we checked was authentic 23andMe user data.That data appeared to contain StockX customers’ personal information, like their name, email address, and a copy of the customer’s scrambled password, along with other information believed unique to StockX, such as the user’s shoe size, what device they were using, and what currency the customer was trading in.But in reality, someone, somewhere (and somehow) removed a password from a server in this supposedly highly fortified cloud, effectively punching a huge hole in this cloud server’s defenses and allowing anyone on the open internet to digitally dive in and peruse the data inside."},"TechCrunch Minute: A TikTok ban is looking more and more like impending

TikTok users who are incensed about, and fighting back against, the potential ban of TikTok.But while the talk of a possible ban is getting all the press, what about the potential of TikTok simply being divested from its parent company, ByteDance?That would resolve the United States government’s issues, right?So, the bill may have two tracks in it for TikTok, but it could really just be a single-issue law in practice."},"Pitch Deck Teardown: SuperScale’s $5.4M Series A

later, the regulator fined Google $113 million for abusing the dominant position of its Google Play Store and ordered the firm to allow app developers to use third-party payments processing services for in-app purchases or for purchasing apps.India’s antitrust regulator has ordered an investigation into Alphabet’s Google amid a dispute with some Indian developers over its in-app billing system, saying the U.Google pulled more than 100 apps from a set of 10 developers in India late last month after the Indian firms had “persistently not complied with its billing policies.The regulator said Google is charging app developers an excessive and unfair service fee ranging from 10% to 30%, which appears to be disproportionate to the economic value of services provided by the company.” Google later restored the apps, but the firms will have to comply with the Play Store billing policies."},"These 61 robotics companies are

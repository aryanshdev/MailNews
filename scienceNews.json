end?":{"img":"https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-024-01333-9/d41586-024-01333-9_27047456.jpg","link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01333-9","content":"In a 1 May preprint2 posted on bioRxiv, scientists at the US Department of Agriculture analysed more than 200 viral genomes taken from cows and found that the virus jumped from wild birds to cattle in late 2023.But there’s no sign that the outbreak in cows is over, and scientists are increasingly concerned that cattle will become a permanent reservoir for this adaptable virus — giving it more chances to mutate and jump to humans.Although the virus kills many types of mammal, most infected cows don’t develop severe symptoms or die1, meaning that no one knows whether an animal is infected without testing it.“If you have a virus that’s hopscotching back and forth between cows, humans and birds, that virus is going to have selective pressures to grow efficiently in all those species,” she says.US officials first announced on 25 March that H5N1 had been found in cattle, and cows from 36 herds in 9 states have tested positive as of 7 May."},"Dozens of Brazilian universities hit by

Isomorphic LabsSince the powerhouse artificial intelligence (AI) tool AlphaFold2 was released in 2021, scientists have used the protein-structure-prediction model to map one of our cells’ biggest machines, discover drugs and chart the universe of every known protein.What’s next for AlphaFold and the AI protein-folding revolutionThe latest version of AlphaFold, described on 8 May in Nature1, aims to do just that — by giving scientists the ability to predict the structures of proteins during interactions with other molecules.Unlike RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold2, scientists will not be able to run their own version of AlphaFold3, nor will the code underlying AlphaFold3 or other information obtained after training the model be made public.How AlphaFold can realize AI’s full potential in structural biologyUhlmann likes what he has so far seen of the server, which he says is simpler and quicker than the version of AlphaFold2 that he has access to at his institute.To create AlphaFold3, Jumper, DeepMind chief executive Demis Hassabis and their colleagues made large changes to its predecessor: the latest version depends less on information about proteins related to a target sequence, for instance."},"Physicists move closer to an ultra-precise ‘nuclear’ clock":{"img":"https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-024-01353-5/d41586-024-01353-5_27064458.jpg","link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01353-5","content":"Atomic clock keeps ultra-precise time aboard a rocking naval shipThe long-sought breakthrough — made by a collaboration between the Vienna University of Technology and Germany’s national metrology institute, the PTB, in Braunschweig — involved using an ultraviolet laser to prompt a nucleus of the radioactive metal thorium-229 to switch between energy states.And in 2003, physicists proposed using thorium-229 as the basis of a super-stable clock, but they needed to find the precise energy of the transition and its corresponding laser frequency, which would have been impossible to predict with any accuracy using theory.Nuclear clocks might be able to detect that wiggle, she says, because the energy of their transition is governed by these forces, and any change in their strength would alter the clock’s tick in a measurable way.A nuclear clock would be around 10,000 times more sensitive to changes in fundamental constants — such as the strength of the electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces — than an optical clock is, says Fuchs.In principle, a nuclear clock could be even more precise than the world’s current best timekeepers, known as optical clocks, and less sensitive to disturbances."},"This

close to its star, indicating that it probably has an atmosphere4.Its host star is bright in our night sky, and because it is large for a rocky planet, it’s easier to study than other planets outside the Solar System."},"Hacking the immune system could slow ageing — here’s how":{"img":"https://media.nature.com/w767/magazine-assets/d41586-024-01274-3/d41586-024-01274-3_27042406.jpg","link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01274-3","content":"“Fixing the drift in them that occurs with time seems to fix a lot of the problems of ageing — not only in the immune system but also in the rest of the body,” says Florian, who is now at the Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain.With so many strands of research coming together, scientists are cautiously hopeful that the immune system will indeed prove to be a key lever in healthy ageing.And, most intriguingly, evidence suggests that immune-system ageing might actually drive the ageing of those organs.“The prospect that reversing immune ageing may control age-related diseases is enticing,” says stem-cell scientist Vittorio Sebastiano at Stanford Medical School in California.The human immune system is a complex beast whose multitudinous cellular and molecular components work together to shape development, protect against infections, help wounds to heal and eliminate cells that threaten to become cancerous."},"US funders to tighten oversight of controversial

Associated Press/Alamy Stock PhotoAfter more than four years of deliberations, US officials have released a policy that outlines how federal funding agencies and research institutions must review and oversee biological experiments that could potentially be misused or spark a pandemic.The latest policy, released on 6 May by the US Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), is the next chapter in a long-running balancing act in the United States between totally banning high-risk pathogen research and assessing it with standards that some say are too ambiguous.Previously, pathogen surveillance and vaccine-development research were not subject to additional oversight in the United States; the latest policy eliminates this carveout, but clarifies that both surveillance and vaccine research are “typically not within the scope” of research in the second category.The policy, which will apply to all research funded by US agencies and take effect in May 2025, broadens oversight of these experiments.The shifting sands of ‘gain-of-function’ researchIn 2014, after several accidents involving mishandled pathogens at US government laboratories, the White House announced a moratorium on research that could make certain pathogens — such as influenza and coronaviruses — more dangerous, given their potential to unleash an epidemic or pandemic."},"Argentina’s pioneering

had to pause construction on two projects that could have brought even more renown to Argentina’s nuclear sector: one is a ‘small modular reactor’ prototype that is among the first in the world to be built for electricity generation, and the other is a research reactor that might have produced enough of the radioisotope molybdenum-99, commonly used in medical diagnostic imaging, to meet 20% of global demand.Credit: CNEA/ReutersOwing to massive budget cuts and lay-offs of government employees, Argentina’s nuclear sector — which includes power plants and research facilities — is at risk, scientists say.Argentina election: front runner vows to slash science funding“It has less electrical production capacity than a nuclear power plant, but it’s also cheaper and safer,” says Tomás Avallone, a chemist and nuclear-reactors operator at the CNEA.The country was the first in Latin America to adopt nuclear energy, has three operating plants that provide about 5–10% of the nation’s electrical energy and runs numerous reactors used for research.Nucleoeléctrica Argentina, a state-run firm based in Buenos Aires that oversees the country’s three nuclear plants, is on the list to be partially privatized."},"China’s Chang’e-6 launched successfully — what happens

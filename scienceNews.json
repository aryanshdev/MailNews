{"AI image generators often give racist and sexist results: can they be fixed?":{"img":"https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-024-00674-9/d41586-024-00674-9_26863658.jpg","link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00674-9","content":"In response to Nature’s questions about which measures are in place to remove harmful or biased content from DALL·E’s training data set, OpenAI pointed to publicly available reports that outline its work to reduce gender and racial bias, without providing exact details on how that’s accomplished.Other researchers have found similar biases across the board: text-to-image generative AI models often produce images that include biased and stereotypical traits related to gender, skin colour, occupations, nationalities and more.AI researchers often assume that the bigger the training data set, the more likely that biases will disappear, says Birhane.In a 2023 study, Birhane and her team compared the data set LAION-400M, which has 400 million image links, with LAION-2B-en, which has 2 billion, and found that hate content in the captions increased by around 12% in the larger data set10, probably because more low-quality data had slipped through.Once it becomes law, it will require that developers of high-risk AI systems provide technical documentation, including datasheets describing the training data and techniques, as well as details about the expected output quality and potential discriminatory impacts, among other information."},"How to stop ‘passing the harasser’: universities urged to join information-sharing scheme":{"img":"https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-024-00795-1/d41586-024-00795-1_26870540.jpg","link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00795-1","content":"In a 2022 legal briefing regarding staff-to-student sexual misconduct in England — with a focus on regulatory compliance in Wales and England, not in Scotland or Northern Ireland — law firm Eversheds Sutherland found that it would be legal for a prospective employer to ask an institutional referee whether an applicant had any live warnings or misconduct findings on file when they left the institution, or whether they were being investigated at the time.Credit: Pawel Libera/LightRocket via GettyBecause most universities keep the findings of misconduct investigations confidential, sexual-harassment perpetrators are often able to move to other institutions without having to disclose why they left their old jobs.Under the scheme, a hiring organization can ask previous employers whether a person has been found to have committed misconduct, following an investigation; what the sanctions were; and whether the individual is part of any ongoing investigations, Bezzolato says.The organization, called the 1752 Group, is a network of UK-based academics that studies and campaigns against sexual misconduct.“Action such as subscription to the Misconduct Disclosure Scheme is for individual universities and colleges to decide on,” says David Smy, the office’s deputy director for enabling regulation."},"Bird-flu threat disrupts Antarctic penguin

programme and is based in Madrid.Scientists have just started a new expedition to sample for bird flu on the Antarctic Peninsula, says Antonio Alcamí, a virologist based at the Severo Ochoa Centre for Molecular Biology in Madrid, who was among those who first detected H5N1 on the mainland.The virus was found in dead skuas near Argentina’s Primavera research station, located on the Antarctic Peninsula, which stretches north towards South America.Antarctic seals recruited to measure effects of climate changeResearchers first detected avian influenza, caused by the circulating H5N1 subtype of the virus, in the wider Antarctic region in October 2023.Research carried out under the US Antarctic Program has not yet been disrupted by bird flu, according to the National Science Foundation

planned Hyper-Kamiokande detector will use purified water as its neutrino-detecting medium, whereas the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment in the United States will rely on liquid argon to measure the elusive particles, says Mary Bishai, a physicist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York and co-spokesperson for the US observatory.If all goes to plan, the US$376 million Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) will be ready to start detecting by the end of this year, says JUNO’s on-site manager Yuekun Heng, a physicist at the Chinese Academy of Science’s Institute of High Energy Physics in Beijing.JUNO sits between two nuclear power stations, each located 53 kilometres away, that will supply the detector with a steady stream of electron antineutrinos, which have the same mass as neutrinos.JUNO’s main goal will be to help researchers determine which type of neutrino has the highest mass and which has the least, one of the biggest mysteries in physics.If levels of these elements are too high, it will be almost impossible to measure neutrinos with the sensitivity needed to solve the mass-ordering problem, says JUNO team member Alberto Garfagnini, a physicist at the University of Padua, Italy."},"First US drug approved for a liver disease surging around the

called resmetirom, has been shown to reduce scar tissue in the liver and other hallmarks of a disease called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH).Jackson/Science Photo LibraryFor the first time, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved a drug to treat an obesity-linked liver disease that is on the rise around the globe and is becoming a leading driver of liver failure and transplants.Weight loss has been associated with a reduction in MASH severity, but an early clinical trial of semaglutide in participants with MASH yielded mixed results: some hallmarks of the disease improved, but liver fibrosis did not2.In a year-long, multinational clinical trial in 966 people with MASH, researchers found that the drug reduced inflammation and fat build-up in 30% of participants who received the highest dose of resmetirom, compared with about 10% of those who took a placebo1.MASH is often associated with the metabolic turmoil that can accompany obesity and diabetes, and in severe cases can lead to liver failure or cancer."},"Ditching ‘Anthropocene’: why ecologists say the term still

of discussion, geologists last week decided that the Anthropocene — generally understood to be the age of irreversible human impacts on the planet — will not become an official epoch in Earth’s geological timeline.Humans versus Earth: the quest to define the AnthropoceneIn a world in which the threat of climate change dominates environmental debates, the term Anthropocene can help to broaden the discussion, says Yadvinder Malhi, a biodiversity researcher at the University of Oxford, UK.“Many people in the humanities who are using the phrase find the concept of the articulation of a particular year, based on a deposit in a particular lake, a ridiculous way of framing the concept of a human-altered planet.”Geologists reject the Anthropocene as Earth’s new epoch — after 15 years of debateThe concept of an era of human-driven change also provides convenient common ground for him to collaborate with researchers from other disciplines.”He adds: “I need that term when I’m trying to capture this idea of humans affecting the planet in multiple ways because of the size of our activity."},"More than 4,000 plastic chemicals are hazardous, report

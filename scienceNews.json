the first immune-cell therapy to win FDA approval for treating solid tumours such as melanoma.Turbocharged CAR-T cells melt tumours in mice — using a trick from cancer cellsFor now, lifileucel can be used only as a last-line treatment in people with certain forms of advanced melanoma that haven’t responded to other treatments.At least 20 people with advanced melanoma have embarked on treatment with what are called tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which target and kill cancer cells.Doctors already deploy immune cells called CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T cells to treat cancer, but CAR-T therapy is used against only blood cancers such as leukaemia.They are the brainchild of Steven Rosenberg, a cancer researcher and surgeon at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, who first showed1 that TILs could shrink tumours in people with melanoma."},"The science of Oppenheimer: meet the Oscar-winning movie’s specialist

the film was as accurate as possible, director Christopher Nolan turned to several science advisers for information on Oppenheimer and his life, and the project itself, which culminated in the Trinity Bomb nuclear test on 16 July 1945 and the subsequent bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, bringing the Second World War to a close at immense human cost.There’s a scene in which Oppenheimer is writing on the chalkboard explaining that nuclear fission is impossible, when Lawrence walks in and says “well, [American physicist Luis Walter] Alvarez just did it next door”.Why Oppenheimer has important lessons for scientists todayRobbert Dijkgraaf, a theoretical physicist and currently the Dutch minister for education, was the director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, from 2012 to 2022, a job Oppenheimer had also held, from 1947 to 1966.Robert Oppenheimer’s life, and its examination of both the human and scientific toll of the Manhattan Project, the research programme that developed the atomic bomb in the 1940s at Los Alamos in New Mexico.And David Saltzberg, a physicist at the University of California, Los Angeles, worked as a scientific consultant for other productions, such as The Big Bang Theory, before applying his expertise to Oppenheimer."},"Blockbuster obesity drug leads to better health in people with

affecting 30–40% of people with HIV is metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, which is characterized by the build-up of fat in the liver.Studies presented last week at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Denver, Colorado, suggest that the anti-obesity drug semaglutide not only helps people with HIV to lose weight but also reduces certain conditions associated with fat accumulation that are especially common in people infected with the virus.Fatty liver disease: turning the tideShe and her colleagues evaluated the use of a weekly injection of semaglutide for around six months in people with both HIV and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.“We do know that people with HIV have a more aggressive form of fatty liver disease,” says Jordan Lake, an infectious-disease physician at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.Obesity drugs have another superpower: taming inflammationIn an earlier clinical trial, Eckard and her colleagues scanned the bodies of people with HIV and lipohypertrophy and found that semaglutide helped to reduce abdominal fat."},"Superconductivity scandal: the

Hamlin sent Nature’s journal team his response to the rebuttal, which proposed an explanation for the odd data: rather than deriving the published data from raw data, Dias had added noise to the published data to generate a set of ‘raw’ data.The news team asked five superconductivity specialists to review key information available to Nature journal editors when they were considering the LuH manuscript: the referee reports for the LuH paper and the reports indicating data fabrication in the CSH paper.Why a blockbuster superconductivity claim met a wall of scepticismPrevious reporting by The Wall Street Journal, Science and Nature’s news team has documented allegations that Dias manipulated data, plagiarized substantial portions of his thesis and attempted to obstruct the investigation of another paper by fabricating data.As Nature journal editors were investigating the CSH paper, the University of Rochester conducted two investigations into Dias’s work; a separate one followed the retraction.The investigation also reveals, for the first time, what happened during the peer-review process for Dias’s second Nature paper on superconductivity."},"China promises more

increase in government spending on science and technology is the largest in five years, says Jing Qian, who heads the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis in New York City.Although the increased spending “represents a bigger commitment by the government towards science and technology”, it is still only a small fraction of the country’s total research and development expenditure, says Hu.Credit: Lintao Zhang/Getty China’s spending on science and technology is set to rise this year, despite the country’s sluggish economic growth.Of the total government spending, 98 billion yuan will go to basic research, an increase of 13%, according to the report."},"Could AI-designed proteins be weaponized?

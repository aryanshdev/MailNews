this moment, going into the map and looking at one individual synapse from this woman’s brain, and then zooming out into these other millions of pixels,” says Jain.“This map provides unprecedented details that can unveil new rules of neural connections and help to decipher the inner working of the human brain,” says Yongsoo Kim, a neuroscientist at Pennsylvania State University in Hershey.“This paper is really the tour de force creation of a human cortex data set,” says Hongkui Zeng, director of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle.The team plans to produce similar maps of brain samples from other people — but a map of the entire brain is unlikely in the next few decades, he says.The 3D map covers a volume of about one cubic millimetre, one-millionth of a whole brain, and contains roughly 57,000 cells and 150 million synapses — the connections between neurons."},"US TikTok ban: how the looming restriction is affecting scientists on the app":{"img":"https://media.nature.com/w767/magazine-assets/d41586-024-01388-8/d41586-024-01388-8_27072026.jpg","link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01388-8","content":"One thing that makes TikTok different from other social-networking apps is how its algorithm curates content from across the platform — not just the accounts a user follows — to appeal to the specific interests of each user, says Matt Motta, a health-communications researcher at Boston University’s School of Public Health.US President Joe Biden signed legislation last month that could trigger a nationwide ban of the popular social-media app TikTok within a year.The Ocean Exploration Trust declined to comment on the legislation, but it has several successful social-media accounts, including on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, to which it could shift its focus if the ban goes into effect.Most of them acknowledge the data-security concerns, but say that the legislation would cut off a thriving platform for science education and outreach, especially among young people who are seeking information from trusted sources.Morgan Johnston, a neuroscientist at the University of Texas at San Antonio, worries that young people who use TikTok will lose an outlet to learn about science and find community."},"Alphafold 3.0: the AI protein predictor gets an

end?":{"img":"https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-024-01333-9/d41586-024-01333-9_27047456.jpg","link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01333-9","content":"In a 1 May preprint2 posted on bioRxiv, scientists at the US Department of Agriculture analysed more than 200 viral genomes taken from cows and found that the virus jumped from wild birds to cattle in late 2023.Although the virus kills many types of mammal, most infected cows don’t develop severe symptoms or die1, meaning that no one knows whether an animal is infected without testing it.But there’s no sign that the outbreak in cows is over, and scientists are increasingly concerned that cattle will become a permanent reservoir for this adaptable virus — giving it more chances to mutate and jump to humans.New data show that the virus can hop back and forth between cows and birds, a trait that could allow it to spread across wide geographical regions.“Cattle are just one big birdfeeder,” Gray says, adding that birds can spread infections much further than cows can and are much less controllable."},"Dozens of Brazilian universities hit by strikes over academic

Isomorphic LabsSince the powerhouse artificial intelligence (AI) tool AlphaFold2 was released in 2021, scientists have used the protein-structure-prediction model to map one of our cells’ biggest machines, discover drugs and chart the universe of every known protein.What’s next for AlphaFold and the AI protein-folding revolutionThe latest version of AlphaFold, described on 8 May in Nature1, aims to do just that — by giving scientists the ability to predict the structures of proteins during interactions with other molecules.To create AlphaFold3, Jumper, DeepMind chief executive Demis Hassabis and their colleagues made large changes to its predecessor: the latest version depends less on information about proteins related to a target sequence, for instance.Unlike RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold2, scientists will not be able to run their own version of AlphaFold3, nor will the code underlying AlphaFold3 or other information obtained after training the model be made public.An ideal tool would be able to predict structures of a protein alongside its accessories, says Jumper."},"Best ever clocks: breakthrough paves way for ultra-precise ‘nuclear’

2003, physicists proposed using thorium-229 as the basis of a super-stable clock, but they needed to find the precise energy of the transition and its corresponding laser frequency, which would have been impossible to predict with any accuracy using theory.Atomic clock keeps ultra-precise time aboard a rocking naval shipThe long-sought breakthrough — made by a collaboration between the Vienna University of Technology and Germany’s national metrology institute, the PTB, in Braunschweig — involved using an ultraviolet laser to prompt a nucleus of the radioactive metal thorium-229 to switch between energy states.In principle, a nuclear clock could be even more precise than the world’s current best timekeepers, known as optical clocks, and less sensitive to disturbances.If all goes well, the team says that a thorium-based nuclear clock could end up being around ten times more accurate than the best optical clocks.Chinese team syncs clocks over record distance using lasersScientific methods that were made possible by super-precise optical clocks, such as probing Earth’s gravitational field by measuring differences in clock speed, “could get a major boost”, says Kocharovskaya."},"‘Milestone’ discovery as JWST confirms atmosphere on an Earth-like

strands of research coming together, scientists are cautiously hopeful that the immune system will indeed prove to be a key lever in healthy ageing.In March3, another team showed that restoring the balance between two key types of immune cell gives old mice more youthful immune systems, improving the animals’ ability to respond to vaccines and to stave off viral infections.“The prospect that reversing immune ageing may control age-related diseases is enticing,” says stem-cell scientist Vittorio Sebastiano at Stanford Medical School in California.Credit: Eva Mejia-RamirezOne of the earliest changes in the immune system as people age is the shrinking of the thymus, which begins after puberty.And, most intriguingly, evidence suggests that immune-system ageing might actually drive the ageing of those organs."}}

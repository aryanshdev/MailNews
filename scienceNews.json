for offspring hatched outside its body.annulatus young could get their mother to eject a fat- and carbohydrate-rich liquid from her cloaca — the combined rear opening for the reproductive and digestive systems — by making high-pitched clicking noises.In the 2000s, researchers showed that in some caecilians, the young hatched with teeth and that they fed on a nutrient-rich layer of their mother’s skin2 around every seven days."},"‘Despair’: Argentinian researchers protest as president begins dismantling

science agency, the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET), might have to shut down.‘Extremely worrying’: Argentinian researchers reel after election of anti-science presidentThe far-right Milei administration has decided that the federal budget will remain unchanged from that in 2023 — which means that, in real terms, funding levels are at least 50% lower this year because of increasing inflation.His administration has not yet appointed a president to the National Agency for the Promotion of Research, Technological Development and Innovation, which had a budget of about US$120 million in 2023 and which helps to finance the work of local researchers by channeling international funding to them.“By promoting budget cuts in science and technology, the government is dismantling the sector,” says Andrea Gamarnik, head of a molecular-virology lab at the Leloir Institute Foundation in Buenos Aires, which is supported by CONICET.“CONICET is in the same budgetary situation as the rest of the national public administration,” that is, it is under the same budget as last year, just like the rest of the government, they said."},"These tiny fish combine electric

biological sciences, initially ran into the same problems trying to reprogram cells from an Asian elephant calf by following the recipe used to make most other iPS cell lines: instructing the cells to overproduce four key reprogramming factors identified by Shinya Yamanaka, a stem-cell scientist at Kyoto University in Japan, in 20061.They are key to Colossal’s plans to create herds of Asian elephants (Elephus maximus) — the closest living relative of extinct woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) — that have been genetically edited to have shaggy hair, extra fat and other mammoth traits.But Church says the new cell lines will be useful for identifying and studying the genetic changes needed to imbue Asian elephants with mammoth traits.To avoid the need for herds of Asian elephant surrogates to carry such embryos to term, Church imagines that artificial wombs, derived in part from iPS cells, would be used.The myriad technologies needed to grow an iPS cell into a mammoth-like elephant might not be even close to ready yet."}}

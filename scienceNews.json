preprint2 posted on bioRxiv, scientists at the US Department of Agriculture analysed more than 200 viral genomes taken from cows and found that the virus jumped from wild birds to cattle in late 2023.Although the virus kills many types of mammal, most infected cows don’t develop severe symptoms or die1, meaning that no one knows whether an animal is infected without testing it.But there’s no sign that the outbreak in cows is over, and scientists are increasingly concerned that cattle will become a permanent reservoir for this adaptable virus — giving it more chances to mutate and jump to humans.“Cattle are just one big birdfeeder,” Gray says, adding that birds can spread infections much further than cows can and are much less controllable.“If you have a virus that’s hopscotching back and forth between cows, humans and birds, that virus is going to have selective pressures to grow efficiently in all those species,” she says."},"Major AlphaFold upgrade offers boost for drug

Isomorphic LabsSince the powerhouse artificial intelligence (AI) tool AlphaFold2 was released in 2021, scientists have used the protein-structure-prediction model to map one of our cells’ biggest machines, discover drugs and chart the universe of every known protein.Unlike RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold2, scientists will not be able to run their own version of AlphaFold3, nor will the code underlying AlphaFold3 or other information obtained after training the model be made public.Because of the restriction on modelling protein interactions with possible drugs, “I can’t see it having the impact AlphaFold2 had”, says Brian Shoichet, a pharmaceutical chemist at the University of California, San Francisco, who has been using AlphaFold structures to hunt for therapeutic candidates.An ideal tool would be able to predict structures of a protein alongside its accessories, says Jumper.To create AlphaFold3, Jumper, DeepMind chief executive Demis Hassabis and their colleagues made large changes to its predecessor: the latest version depends less on information about proteins related to a target sequence, for instance."},"This Earth-like exoplanet is the first confirmed to have an

outside the Solar System1.But in 2011, the Spitzer Space Telescope observed the planet as it passed in front of its star3, and researchers found that 55 Cancri e is in fact a lot smaller and denser than a gas giant, making it a rocky super-Earth.Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, Dani Player (STScI)Some years later, researchers noticed that 55 Cancri e was cooler than it should have been for a planet so close to its star, indicating that it probably has an atmosphere4.Its host star is bright in our night sky, and because it is large for a rocky planet, it’s easier to study than other planets outside the Solar System."},"Hacking the immune system could slow ageing — here’s how":{"img":"https://media.nature.com/w767/magazine-assets/d41586-024-01274-3/d41586-024-01274-3_27042406.jpg","link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01274-3","content":"As a first case study, she thinks her drug might support regeneration of the immune system after people receive chemotherapy for cancer.“The prospect that reversing immune ageing may control age-related diseases is enticing,” says stem-cell scientist Vittorio Sebastiano at Stanford Medical School in California.This organ is the crucible for T cells, but a lot of the tissue has turned to fat by the time people hit their 30s, slashing the production of new T cells and diminishing the power of the immune system.“Fixing the drift in them that occurs with time seems to fix a lot of the problems of ageing — not only in the immune system but also in the rest of the body,” says Florian, who is now at the Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain.The immune system has two main components: a fast-acting innate system, which destroys invading pathogens indiscriminately, and a more-precise adaptive immune system, whose components learn to recognize specific foreign bacteria and viruses and generate antibodies against them."},"US funders to tighten oversight of controversial ‘gain-of-function’

Associated Press/Alamy Stock PhotoAfter more than four years of deliberations, US officials have released a policy that outlines how federal funding agencies and research institutions must review and oversee biological experiments that could potentially be misused or spark a pandemic.The latest policy, released on 6 May by the US Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), is the next chapter in a long-running balancing act in the United States between totally banning high-risk pathogen research and assessing it with standards that some say are too ambiguous.Previously, pathogen surveillance and vaccine-development research were not subject to additional oversight in the United States; the latest policy eliminates this carveout, but clarifies that both surveillance and vaccine research are “typically not within the scope” of research in the second category.The policy, which will apply to all research funded by US agencies and take effect in May 2025, broadens oversight of these experiments.The shifting sands of ‘gain-of-function’ researchIn 2014, after several accidents involving mishandled pathogens at US government laboratories, the White House announced a moratorium on research that could make certain pathogens — such as influenza and coronaviruses — more dangerous, given their potential to unleash an epidemic or pandemic."},"Argentina’s pioneering

had to pause construction on two projects that could have brought even more renown to Argentina’s nuclear sector: one is a ‘small modular reactor’ prototype that is among the first in the world to be built for electricity generation, and the other is a research reactor that might have produced enough of the radioisotope molybdenum-99, commonly used in medical diagnostic imaging, to meet 20% of global demand.Credit: CNEA/ReutersOwing to massive budget cuts and lay-offs of government employees, Argentina’s nuclear sector — which includes power plants and research facilities — is at risk, scientists say.Argentina election: front runner vows to slash science funding“It has less electrical production capacity than a nuclear power plant, but it’s also cheaper and safer,” says Tomás Avallone, a chemist and nuclear-reactors operator at the CNEA.The country was the first in Latin America to adopt nuclear energy, has three operating plants that provide about 5–10% of the nation’s electrical energy and runs numerous reactors used for research.One of the stalled nuclear projects is the small modular reactor CAREM, intended to supply low-carbon electricity to rural areas where large power plants can’t be built."},"China's Chang'e-6 launches successfully — what happens

mission to collect rocks from the Moon’s far side could revealA total of 10 missions, manned or unmanned, have brought back Moon rocks for analysis — all from the near side.If all goes according to plan, scientists will be examining the first rocks from the Moon’s far side by late June.Landing on the Moon’s far side requires, among other things, a communications satellite to relay signals with Earth.Scientists hope Chang’e-6 will also return material from beyond its landing site, such as rock fragments thrown over to the landing site from far distant locations during powerful impacts, Jolliff says.The lunar far side, which always faces away from us because the Moon is tidally locked to Earth, could not be more different than its near side, says planetary scientist Bradley Jolliff at Washington University in St Louis."},"Puppy-dog eyes in wild canines sparks rethink on dog

of puppy dog eyesIf the social dynamic between humans and dogs drove eyebrow evolution, Smith wondered whether the highly social African wild dog might also have expressive brows.Although the researchers only looked at one African wild dog, Smith says it’s unlikely that such a large and well-developed muscle would be present in one animal and not others.Smith, who is based at Midwestern University in Glendale, Arizona, and her colleagues dissected a recently deceased African wild dog from Phoenix Zoo.Her team’s work has thrown a 2019 finding1 that the muscles in dogs’ eyebrows evolved to communicate with humans in the doghouse by showing that African wild dogs also have the muscles to make the infamous pleading expression.The team proposes that the gregarious African wild dogs evolved these muscles to communicate with each other."},"Dark energy is tearing the Universe apart.

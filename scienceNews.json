Chinese manufacturers lag behind US tech giants":{"img":"https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-024-01292-1/d41586-024-01292-1_27039264.jpg","link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01292-1","content":"China’s leading competitor to Nvidia, Huawei, has sought to develop its own AI chips, but Banafa says China is still “at least five to ten years” behind the United States, partly because it cannot get access to the most advanced equipment needed to produce such chips.China’s best efforts, from Huawei, are still at around 7 nm, meaning that Chinese companies have to use more chips to achieve the same computing power as one advanced chip.Yunji Chen, a computer scientist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Computing Technology in Beijing, and his colleagues said in the past year that they have developed the first chip to be designed by AI without human input1, called Enlightenment-1.There has been some good news for Chinese chip development — using AI itself to design computer chips."},"‘Orangutan, heal thyself’: First wild animal seen using medicinal plant":{"img":"https://media.nature.com/w767/magazine-assets/d41586-024-01289-w/d41586-024-01289-w_27042366.jpg","link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01289-w","content":"It’s the first scientific record of a wild animal healing a wound using a plant with known medicinal properties.An orangutan in Sumatra surprised scientists when he was seen treating an open wound on his cheek with a poultice made from a medicinal plant.The researchers observed Rakus fighting with other flanged males to establish dominance and, in June 2022, a field assistant noted an open wound on his face, possibly made by the canines of another male, Schuppli says.“It is the first study to scientifically demonstrate that an animal is using a plant with medicinal properties applicable to wounds, and putting those on the wounds and consistently treating over a period of time,” says Michael Huffman, who studies animal self-medication at the Institute for Tropical Medicine at Nagasaki University in Japan."},"UTIs make life miserable — scientists are finding new ways to tackle them":{"img":"https://media.nature.com/w767/magazine-assets/d41586-024-01322-y/d41586-024-01322-y_27045780.jpg","link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01322-y","content":"The latest approaches include an oral vaccine — which, in trials, prevented recurrent UTIs in participants for up to nine years — as well as the development of non-antibiotic drugs.The findings prompted the European Association of Urology, which provides UTI-treatment guidelines to clinicians across Europe, to strongly recommend the use of methenamine hippurate to prevent UTIs in people without anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract.In another conference talk, researchers showed that delivering the antibiotic gentamicin directly into a person’s bladder, rather than through oral antibiotics, can reduce antibiotic resistance among UTI-causing bacteria.Before treatment with gentamicin, multidrug resistance was present in bacteria sampled from 44% of the people treated."},"Dad’s

to lessen fear, and encourage clearer, less divisive thinking, we have asked three contributors to a special series of opinion pieces on sex and gender to come together and thrash out how exactly scientists can fill in years of neglected research – and move forward with exploring the differences between individuals in a way that is responsible, inclusive and beneficial to as many people as possible.Download Podcast: Sex and gender discussions don't need to be toxicEver since scientific enquiry began, people have focused mainly on men, or if studies involve animals, on male mice, male rats or whatever it may be.These days, mainly thanks to big funders like the NIH introducing new guidelines and mandates, a lot more scientists are thinking about sex and, where appropriate, gender.It is clear that sex and gender exist beyond a simple binary."},"Why is exercise good for you?

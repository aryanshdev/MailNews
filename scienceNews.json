{"AI image generators often give racist and sexist results: can they be fixed?":{"img":"https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-024-00674-9/d41586-024-00674-9_26863658.jpg","link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00674-9","content":"Other researchers have found similar biases across the board: text-to-image generative AI models often produce images that include biased and stereotypical traits related to gender, skin colour, occupations, nationalities and more.In response to Nature’s questions about which measures are in place to remove harmful or biased content from DALL·E’s training data set, OpenAI pointed to publicly available reports that outline its work to reduce gender and racial bias, without providing exact details on how that’s accomplished.In a 2023 study, Birhane and her team compared the data set LAION-400M, which has 400 million image links, with LAION-2B-en, which has 2 billion, and found that hate content in the captions increased by around 12% in the larger data set10, probably because more low-quality data had slipped through.Even with a focus on bias, however, there’s still the question of what the ideal output of AI should be, researchers say — a social question with no simple answer.After some digging, Kalluri and her colleagues found that images generated by the popular tools Stable Diffusion, released by the firm Stability AI, and DALL·E, from OpenAI, overwhelmingly resorted to common stereotypes, such as associating the word ‘Africa’ with poverty, or ‘poor’ with dark skin tones."},"‘A landmark moment’: scientists use AI to design antibodies from scratch":{"img":"https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-024-00846-7/d41586-024-00846-7_26875082.jpg","link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00846-7","content":"Watson says that about one in 100 antibody designs worked as hoped — a lower success rate than the team now achieves with other types of AI-designed protein.The proof-of-principle work, reported this week in a preprint on bioRxiv1, raises the possibility of bringing AI-guided protein design to the therapeutic antibody market, which is worth hundreds of billions of dollars.Bennett and his colleagues used an AI tool that their team released last year2 that has helped to transform protein design.“It’s a really promising piece of research” that represents an important step in applying AI protein-design tools to making new antibodies, says Charlotte Deane, an immuno-informatician at the University of Oxford, UK.AI tools that can shortcut those costly efforts have the potential to “democratize the ability to design antibodies”, says study co-author Nathaniel Bennett, a computational biochemist at the University of Washington in Seattle."},"How to stop ‘passing the harasser’: universities urged

legal briefing regarding staff-to-student sexual misconduct in England — with a focus on regulatory compliance in Wales and England, not in Scotland or Northern Ireland — law firm Eversheds Sutherland found that it would be legal for a prospective employer to ask an institutional referee whether an applicant had any live warnings or misconduct findings on file when they left the institution, or whether they were being investigated at the time.“Action such as subscription to the Misconduct Disclosure Scheme is for individual universities and colleges to decide on,” says David Smy, the office’s deputy director for enabling regulation.Under the scheme, a hiring organization can ask previous employers whether a person has been found to have committed misconduct, following an investigation; what the sanctions were; and whether the individual is part of any ongoing investigations, Bezzolato says.The organization, called the 1752 Group, is a network of UK-based academics that studies and campaigns against sexual misconduct.Another 2018 review, which examined more than 300 cases of faculty–student sexual harassment in the United States, found that more than half of perpetrators were serial harassers, and perpetrators often relocated to different institutions and repeated the same pattern of misconduct."},"Bird-flu threat disrupts Antarctic penguin

first time I remember such reduced access to animal colonies since I started my Antarctic career in 1996,” says microbiologist Antonio Quesada del Corral, who manages the Spanish Antarctic research programme and is based in Madrid.Scientists have just started a new expedition to sample for bird flu on the Antarctic Peninsula, says Antonio Alcamí, a virologist based at the Severo Ochoa Centre for Molecular Biology in Madrid, who was among those who first detected H5N1 on the mainland.The virus was found in dead skuas near Argentina’s Primavera research station, located on the Antarctic Peninsula, which stretches north towards South America.Research carried out under the US Antarctic Program has not yet been disrupted by bird flu, according to the National Science Foundation (NSF), which funds the programme.In the sub-Antarctic, the virus is known to have spread to elephant and fur seals, albatrosses, terns, gentoo penguins and king penguins, suggesting that these animals are also at risk in Antarctica."},"China’s giant underground neutrino lab prepares to probe cosmic

between two nuclear power stations, each located 53 kilometres away, that will supply the detector with a steady stream of electron antineutrinos, which have the same mass as neutrinos.JUNO’s main goal will be to help researchers determine which type of neutrino has the highest mass and which has the least, one of the biggest mysteries in physics.If all goes to plan, the US$376 million Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) will be ready to start detecting by the end of this year, says JUNO’s on-site manager Yuekun Heng, a physicist at the Chinese Academy of Science’s Institute of High Energy Physics in Beijing.Japan’s planned Hyper-Kamiokande detector will use purified water as its neutrino-detecting medium, whereas the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment in the United States will rely on liquid argon to measure the elusive particles, says Mary Bishai, a physicist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York and co-spokesperson for the US observatory.If levels of these elements are too high, it will be almost impossible to measure neutrinos with the sensitivity needed to solve the mass-ordering problem, says JUNO team member Alberto Garfagnini, a physicist at the University of Padua, Italy."},"First US drug approved for a liver disease surging around the

Photo LibraryFor the first time, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved a drug to treat an obesity-linked liver disease that is on the rise around the globe and is becoming a leading driver of liver failure and transplants.The drug, called resmetirom, has been shown to reduce scar tissue in the liver and other hallmarks of a disease called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH).Weight loss has been associated with a reduction in MASH severity, but an early clinical trial of semaglutide in participants with MASH yielded mixed results: some hallmarks of the disease improved, but liver fibrosis did not2.In a year-long, multinational clinical trial in 966 people with MASH, researchers found that the drug reduced inflammation and fat build-up in 30% of participants who received the highest dose of resmetirom, compared with about 10% of those who took a placebo1.MASH is often associated with the metabolic turmoil that can accompany obesity and diabetes, and in severe cases can lead to liver failure or cancer."},"Ditching ‘Anthropocene’: why ecologists say the term still

of discussion, geologists last week decided that the Anthropocene — generally understood to be the age of irreversible human impacts on the planet — will not become an official epoch in Earth’s geological timeline.“Many people in the humanities who are using the phrase find the concept of the articulation of a particular year, based on a deposit in a particular lake, a ridiculous way of framing the concept of a human-altered planet.”Humans versus Earth: the quest to define the AnthropoceneIn a world in which the threat of climate change dominates environmental debates, the term Anthropocene can help to broaden the discussion, says Yadvinder Malhi, a biodiversity researcher at the University of Oxford, UK.Geologists reject the Anthropocene as Earth’s new epoch — after 15 years of debateThe concept of an era of human-driven change also provides convenient common ground for him to collaborate with researchers from other disciplines.”He adds: “I need that term when I’m trying to capture this idea of humans affecting the planet in multiple ways because of the size of our activity."},"More than 4,000 plastic chemicals are hazardous, report

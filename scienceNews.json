no longer exists,” says Gilles Verniers, a political scientist who was forced to leave his position as head of an election research centre at the private Ashoka University in Sonipat, just north of New Delhi, in September 2023.In a statement to Nature, Ashoka University said that Verniers did not pass the stringent tenure process at the university, and that the TCPD’s integration into the new centre — which provides “a repository of open access public data across interdisciplinary fields, which include social, climate, computer, biosciences, among other fields” — “has no connection with any funding or other external factors”.He says that the furore, which included public allegations that he misrepresented the data, led donors to get nervous, and eventually caused Ashoka University to absorb his centre into a new one, making him redundant in the process.Misinformation poses a bigger threat to democracy than you might thinkZsolt Enyedi, a political scientist at the Central European

revolutionary technique got people with spinal-cord injuries back on their feetThe researchers also compared the cellular responses to injury in young and old mice.They also found that injury immediately impairs the function of cells that form the blood–spinal cord barrier and the arachnoid barrier — a protective membrane that covers the spinal cord.“If you know what every single cell on the spinal cord is doing in response to injury, you could use that knowledge to develop tailor-made and mechanism-based therapies,” says Mark Anderson, a neurobiologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Geneva, Switzerland, who worked on the atlas.When injected into the lower thoracic spinal cord in old mice two days before SCI, the treatment increased the number of border-forming astrocytes, reduced the infiltration of harmful immune cells and helped to restore the integrity of the blood–spinal cord barrier.The model, known as a cell atlas, could help researchers to resolve outstanding questions and develop new treatments for people with spinal-cord injury (SCI)."},"Not all ‘open source’ AI models are actually open: here’s a

MirageC/GettyTechnology giants such as Meta and Microsoft are describing their artificial intelligence (AI) models as ‘open source’ while failing to disclose important information about the underlying technology, say researchers who analysed a host of popular chatbot models.“It’s fair to say the term open source will take on unprecedented legal weight in the countries governed by the EU AI Act,” says Dingemanse.The EU’s AI Act, which passed this year, will exempt open-source general-purpose models, up to a certain size, from extensive transparency requirements, and commit them to lesser and as-yet-undefined obligations.But given the complexity of large AI models and the huge volumes of data involved, making them open source is far from straightforward, and experts are still working to

researchers, who last year made the research public on the preprint server bioRxiv ahead of peer review, also found that the genitalia of male and female mice contain about the same number of corpuscles, which spread out spatially as the organs grow during the animals’ development.Specific nerve cells on the penis and clitoris detect vibrations and then become activated, causing sexual behaviours such as erections, a study in mice has revealed1.Although most sensory neurons are developed before birth, the researchers found that Krause corpuscles didn’t develop until the mice were around 4–6 weeks old — just before the animals reached sexual maturity.The findings could lead to new treatments for conditions such as erectile dysfunction, or for restoring sexual function in people with lower-body paralysis."},"Cheaper versions of blockbuster obesity drugs are being created in India and

platform Twitter (as it was then known) by Russian sources influence the 2016 US election?More recently, misinformation has been blamed for a swathe of social and political trends — from people’s reluctance to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and rising discrimination against migrants, to the Brexit vote for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union and scepticism about the seriousness of climate change.Credit: Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu/Getty For example, misinformation about the validity of the 2020 US presidential election was amplified and spread by a subset of Trump supporters to trigger the attack on the US Capitol building on 6 January 2021.The rise of such AI fakery has made more people than ever concerned about the effect of misinformation on elections, particularly because 2024 is a standout year for democracy.One recent study2 concluded that, in a sample of nearly 665,000 US registered voters on X (formerly Twitter), just over 2,100 people accounted for 80% of the fake news shared about this election."}}

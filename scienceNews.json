What the data say":{"img":"https://media.nature.com/w767/magazine-assets/d41586-024-00720-6/d41586-024-00720-6_26833340.jpg","link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00720-6","content":"Cohn and Caitlin Murphy, an epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, have already tried combing through the data to look for ties to early-onset cancers, and have found a possible association between early colorectal cancer and prenatal exposure to a particular synthetic form of progesterone, sometimes taken to prevent premature labour6.A team funded by Cancer Research UK, the US National Cancer Institute and others will analyse data from the United States, Mexico and several European countries, to look for environmental exposures and other possible influences on early-onset cancer risk.Because the number of early-onset cancer cases is still relatively small at any one centre, this kind of international coordination is important to give statistical analyses more power, says Kimmie Ng, founding director of the Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer Center at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.Eng is developing a project to look at possible correlations between microbiome composition and the onset of cancer at a young age, and she plans to combine her data with those from collaborators in Africa, Europe and South America.Although colorectal cancer rates are falling in people over 50 years old, the age group that is still most likely to be screened, the rates in younger Alaska Native people are climbing by 5."},"Ancient malaria genome from Roman

difficult to find signs of malaria in ancient human remains, and DNA from the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium rarely shows up in them.But he adds that the results should be interpreted with caution because there are only a few samples, and points out that a genome sequence from DNA in the parasite’s cell nuclei, rather than its mitochondria, “might indicate a more complex story of parasite movement among ancient human populations”.falciparum was eliminated in Europe a half century ago, and genetic data from European parasites — ancient or recent — has been an elusive piece in the puzzle of understanding how humans have moved parasites around the globe,” says Daniel Neafsey, who studies the genomics of malaria parasites and mosquito vectors at the Harvard T.Credit: Dennis Kunkel Microscopy/Science Photo LibraryResearchers have sequenced the mitochondrial genome of the deadliest form of malaria from an ancient Roman skeleton.Researchers can glean valuable information about the origin, evolution and virulence of the parasite from DNA extracted from the ancient remains of infected people."},"Massive experiment shows how to get people vaccinated: bring the vaccine to them":{"img":"https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-024-00730-4/d41586-024-00730-4_26839038.jpg","link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00730-4","content":"COVID-19: talk of ‘vaccine hesitancy’ lets governments off the hookIn addition to vaccine supply issues, another possible reason for this disparity is that nearly 60% of people in sub-Saharan Africa live in rural areas, where medical care can be inaccessible.For example, when COVID-19 vaccines first became available, people in rural Sierra Leone, in western Africa, needed to make, on average, a seven-hour round trip to receive the jab, at a total cost that could exceed a week’s wages, Mobarak says.Credit: Conor O'Donovan/Concern WorldwideDeploying mobile COVID-19 vaccination clinics in rural areas of Sierra Leone increased vaccination rates sharply, according to an ambitious experiment involving 150 villages1.By November 2023, more than 80% of people in high-income countries had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, compared with rouhgly one-third of the population of Africa.“The investigators made a great effort to bring vaccines to remote communities,” says Jean Nachega, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, who has highlighted challenges in COVID-19 vaccine access in Africa2."},"How OpenAI’s text-to-video tool Sora could

might be to require text-to-video AI to use watermarks, either in the form of a visible mark on the video, labelling it as AI, or as a telltale artificial signature in the video’s metadata, but Lees isn’t sure this will be successful.Sora is one of several AI tools that generates video from text promptsCredit: OpenAIThe release of OpenAI’s Sora text-to-video AI tool last month was met with a mix of trepidation and excitement from researchers who are concerned about misuse of the technology.Tracy Harwood, a digital-culture specialist at De Montfort University in Leicester, UK, says she is “shocked” by the speed at which text-to-video artificial intelligence (AI) has developed.Another potential use might be in health care, with text-to-video AI able to talk to patients in place of a human doctor.A year ago, people were laughing at an AI-produced video of the US actor Will Smith eating spaghetti."},"China–US climate collaboration concerns as Xie and Kerry step

the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which was signed into law in 2022 to boost investments in semiconductors and science, authorized up to $35 billion in funding for science and innovation at major science agencies in the 2025 fiscal year, but the White House has requested only $20 billion, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Washington DC.The White House is seeking a substantial boost for the US Environmental Protection Agency in the 2025 fiscal year, but Congress moved in the opposite direction last week: the agency’s overall budget in the 2024 fiscal year will be 9.The White House proposal sets the stage for a new round of budget negotiations, but for Carney the most pressing question is how and when Congress will resolve questions about

people with advanced melanoma have embarked on treatment with what are called tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which target and kill cancer cells.Turbocharged CAR-T cells melt tumours in mice — using a trick from cancer cellsFor now, lifileucel can be used only as a last-line treatment in people with certain forms of advanced melanoma that haven’t responded to other treatments.And it is the first immune-cell therapy to win FDA approval for treating solid tumours such as melanoma.Doctors already deploy immune cells called CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T cells to treat cancer, but CAR-T therapy is used against only blood cancers such as leukaemia.They are the brainchild of Steven Rosenberg, a cancer researcher and surgeon at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, who first showed1 that TILs could shrink tumours in people with melanoma."},"The science of Oppenheimer: meet the Oscar-winning movie’s specialist

the film was as accurate as possible, director Christopher Nolan turned to several science advisers for information on Oppenheimer and his life, and the project itself, which culminated in the Trinity nuclear test on 16 July 1945 and the subsequent bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, bringing the Second World War to a close at immense human cost.There’s a scene in which Oppenheimer is writing on the chalkboard explaining that nuclear fission is impossible, when Lawrence walks in and says “well, [US physicist Luis Walter] Alvarez just did it next door”.Why Oppenheimer has important lessons for scientists todayRobbert Dijkgraaf, a theoretical physicist and currently the Dutch minister for education, was the director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey,

affecting 30–40% of people with HIV is metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, which is characterized by the build-up of fat in the liver.Studies presented last week at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Denver, Colorado, suggest that the anti-obesity drug semaglutide not only helps people with HIV to lose weight but also reduces certain conditions associated with fat accumulation that are especially common in people infected with the virus.“We do know that people with HIV have a more aggressive form of fatty liver disease,” says Jordan Lake, an infectious-disease physician at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.Fatty liver disease: turning the tideShe and her colleagues evaluated the use of a weekly injection of semaglutide for around six months in people with both HIV and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.Game-changing obesity drugs go mainstream: what scientists are learningThe number of people who are overweight or have obesity is increasing among those with HIV, driving interest among both affected individuals and medical providers in medications such as semaglutide, says Daniel Lee, a physician at the University of California San Diego Medical Center."}}

end?":{"img":"https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-024-01333-9/d41586-024-01333-9_27047456.jpg","link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01333-9","content":"In a 1 May preprint2 posted on bioRxiv, scientists at the US Department of Agriculture analysed more than 200 viral genomes taken from cows and found that the virus jumped from wild birds to cattle in late 2023.Although the virus kills many types of mammal, most infected cows don’t develop severe symptoms or die1, meaning that no one knows whether an animal is infected without testing it.But there’s no sign that the outbreak in cows is over, and scientists are increasingly concerned that cattle will become a permanent reservoir for this adaptable virus — giving it more chances to mutate and jump to humans.New data show that the virus can hop back and forth between cows and birds, a trait that could allow it to spread across wide geographical regions.Moreover, a single cow can host several types of flu virus, which could, over time, swap genetic material to generate a strain that can more readily infect humans."},"Dozens of Brazilian universities hit by strikes over academic

Isomorphic LabsSince the powerhouse artificial intelligence (AI) tool AlphaFold2 was released in 2021, scientists have used the protein-structure-prediction model to map one of our cells’ biggest machines, discover drugs and chart the universe of every known protein.What’s next for AlphaFold and the AI protein-folding revolutionThe latest version of AlphaFold, described on 8 May in Nature1, aims to do just that — by giving scientists the ability to predict the structures of proteins during interactions with other molecules.To create AlphaFold3, Jumper, DeepMind chief executive Demis Hassabis and their colleagues made large changes to its predecessor: the latest version depends less on information about proteins related to a target sequence, for instance.Unlike RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold2, scientists will not be able to run their own version of AlphaFold3, nor will the code underlying AlphaFold3 or other information obtained after training the model be made public.An ideal tool would be able to predict structures of a protein alongside its accessories, says Jumper."},"Physicists move closer to an ultra-precise ‘nuclear’ clock":{"img":"https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-024-01353-5/d41586-024-01353-5_27064458.jpg","link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01353-5","content":"Atomic clock keeps ultra-precise time aboard a rocking naval shipThe long-sought breakthrough — made by a collaboration between the Vienna University of Technology and Germany’s national metrology institute, the PTB, in Braunschweig — involved using an ultraviolet laser to prompt a nucleus of the radioactive metal thorium-229 to switch between energy states.And in 2003, physicists proposed using thorium-229 as the basis of a super-stable clock, but they needed to find the precise energy of the transition and its corresponding laser frequency, which would have been impossible to predict with any accuracy using theory.In principle, a nuclear clock could be even more precise than the world’s current best timekeepers, known as optical clocks, and less sensitive to disturbances.A nuclear clock would be around 10,000 times more sensitive to changes in fundamental constants — such as the strength of the electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces — than an optical clock is, says Fuchs.If all goes well, the team says that a thorium-based nuclear clock could end up being around 10 times more accurate than the best optical clocks."},"This Earth-like exoplanet is the first confirmed to have an

outside the Solar System1.But in 2011, the Spitzer Space Telescope observed the planet as it passed in front of its star3, and researchers found that 55 Cancri e is in fact a lot smaller and denser than a gas giant, making it a rocky super-Earth.Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, Dani Player (STScI)Some years later, researchers noticed that 55 Cancri e was cooler than it should have been for a planet so close to its star, indicating that it probably has an atmosphere4.Its host star is bright in our night sky, and because it is large for a rocky planet, it’s easier to study than other planets outside the Solar System."},"Hacking the immune system could slow ageing — here’s how":{"img":"https://media.nature.com/w767/magazine-assets/d41586-024-01274-3/d41586-024-01274-3_27042406.jpg","link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01274-3","content":"And, most intriguingly, evidence suggests that immune-system ageing might actually drive the ageing of those organs.As a first case study, she thinks her drug might support regeneration of the immune system after people receive chemotherapy for cancer.“The prospect that reversing immune ageing may control age-related diseases is enticing,” says stem-cell scientist Vittorio Sebastiano at Stanford Medical School in California.In March3, another team showed that restoring the balance between two key types of immune cell gives old mice more youthful immune systems, improving the animals’ ability to respond to vaccines and to stave off viral infections.“Fixing the drift in them that occurs with time seems to fix a lot of the problems of ageing — not only in the immune system but also in the rest of the body,” says Florian, who is now at the Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain."},"US funders to tighten oversight of controversial ‘gain-of-function’

Associated Press/Alamy Stock PhotoAfter more than four years of deliberations, US officials have released a policy that outlines how federal funding agencies and research institutions must review and oversee biological experiments that could potentially be misused or spark a pandemic.Previously, pathogen surveillance and vaccine-development research were not subject to additional oversight in the United States; the latest policy eliminates this carveout, but clarifies that both surveillance and vaccine research are “typically not within the scope” of research in the second category.The latest policy, released on 6 May by the US Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), is the next chapter in a long-running balancing act in the United States between totally banning high-risk pathogen research and assessing it with standards that some say are too ambiguous.A new US policy, which goes into effect in one year, provides stricter oversight of risky pathogen research conducted in biosafety facilities.The shifting sands of ‘gain-of-function’ researchIn 2014, after several accidents involving mishandled pathogens at US government laboratories, the White House announced a moratorium on research that could make certain pathogens — such as influenza and coronaviruses — more dangerous, given their potential to unleash an epidemic or pandemic."},"Argentina’s pioneering

had to pause construction on two projects that could have brought even more renown to Argentina’s nuclear sector: one is a ‘small modular reactor’ prototype that is among the first in the world to be built for electricity generation, and the other is a research reactor that might have produced enough of the radioisotope molybdenum-99, commonly used in medical diagnostic imaging, to meet 20% of global demand.Credit: CNEA/ReutersOwing to massive budget cuts and lay-offs of government employees, Argentina’s nuclear sector — which includes power plants and research facilities — is at risk, scientists say.Argentina election: front runner vows to slash science funding“It has less electrical production capacity than a nuclear power plant, but it’s also cheaper and safer,” says Tomás Avallone, a chemist and nuclear-reactors operator at the CNEA.Nucleoeléctrica Argentina, a state-run firm based in Buenos Aires that oversees the country’s three nuclear plants, is on the list to be partially privatized.The country was the first in Latin America to adopt nuclear energy, has three operating plants that provide about 5–10% of the nation’s electrical energy and runs numerous reactors used for research."},"China's Chang'e-6 launches successfully — what happens

June.The lunar far side, which always faces away from us because the Moon is tidally locked to Earth, could not be more different than its near side, says planetary scientist Bradley Jolliff at Washington University in St Louis.Most of the ancient volcanic activity on the Moon happened on the near side, while the far side remained quieter under a thick and heavily cratered crust."}}

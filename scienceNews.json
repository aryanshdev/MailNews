development that I think is important and exciting is a growing recognition that AI systems themselves have a pretty large environmental impact, in terms of energy use and also water consumption for cooling the data centres.If staffers or anyone in the congressional offices have ideas about ways to encourage AI innovation, or to regulate it or keep it safe, I’m able to assess that from a technical perspective and say, first of all, do these words make sense, and is that feasible, and what might be overlooked.The six of us who were chosen to be AI fellows reported to Washington DC on September 1 of last year.Article collection: Science and the new age of AICertain kinds of falsehoods are already illegal, of course, and if you use generative AI and it falls into that category, you can just use existing law to deal with that.Half a dozen AI scientists have moved to Washington DC to advise the US Congress."},"Cubic millimetre of brain mapped in spectacular

provides unprecedented details that can unveil new rules of neural connections and help to decipher the inner working of the human brain,” says Yongsoo Kim, a neuroscientist at Pennsylvania State University in Hershey.“I remember this moment, going into the map and looking at one individual synapse from this woman’s brain, and then zooming out into these other millions of pixels,” says Jain.“This paper is really the tour de force creation of a human cortex data set,” says Hongkui Zeng, director of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle.The team plans to produce similar maps of brain samples from other people — but a map of the entire brain is unlikely in the next few decades, he says.The 3D map covers a volume of about one cubic millimetre, one-millionth of a whole brain, and contains roughly 57,000 cells and 150 million synapses — the connections between neurons."},"US TikTok ban: how the looming restriction is affecting scientists on the app":{"img":"https://media.nature.com/w767/magazine-assets/d41586-024-01388-8/d41586-024-01388-8_27072026.jpg","link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01388-8","content":"US President Joe Biden signed legislation last month that could trigger a nationwide ban of the popular social-media app TikTok within a year.One thing that makes TikTok different from other social-networking apps is how its algorithm curates content from across the platform — not just the accounts a user follows — to appeal to the specific interests of each user, says Matt Motta, a health-communications researcher at Boston University’s School of Public Health.Morgan Johnston, a neuroscientist at the University of Texas at San Antonio, worries that young people who use TikTok will lose an outlet to learn about science and find community.The Ocean Exploration Trust declined to comment on the legislation, but it has several successful social-media accounts, including on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, to which it could shift its focus if the ban goes into effect.Most of them acknowledge the data-security concerns, but say that the legislation would cut off a thriving platform for science education and outreach, especially among young people who are seeking information from trusted sources."},"Alphafold 3.0: the AI protein predictor gets an

preprint2 posted on bioRxiv, scientists at the US Department of Agriculture analysed more than 200 viral genomes taken from cows and found that the virus jumped from wild birds to cattle in late 2023.But there’s no sign that the outbreak in cows is over, and scientists are increasingly concerned that cattle will become a permanent reservoir for this adaptable virus — giving it more chances to mutate and jump to humans.Although the virus kills many types of mammal, most infected cows don’t develop severe symptoms or die1, meaning that no one knows whether an animal is infected without testing it.New data show that the virus can hop back and forth between cows and birds, a trait that could allow it to spread across wide geographical regions.“Cattle are just one big birdfeeder,” Gray says, adding that birds can spread infections much further than cows can and are much less controllable."},"Dozens of Brazilian universities hit by strikes over academic

inflation, says Luiz Davidovich, a physicist at the University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and a former president of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences.But he sympathizes with those who decided to strike and hopes the situation will raise public awareness and put pressure on the administration and Congress to act.For botanist Adriana Lobão, the vote to go on strike took place at her institution, Fluminense Federal University in Niteroi, on 29 April.The strikes present a major test for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a long-time labour leader who entered office last year and promised to boost funding for science and education."},"Major AlphaFold upgrade offers boost for drug

Isomorphic LabsSince the powerhouse artificial intelligence (AI) tool AlphaFold2 was released in 2021, scientists have used the protein-structure-prediction model to map one of our cells’ biggest machines, discover drugs and chart the universe of every known protein.What’s next for AlphaFold and the AI protein-folding revolutionThe latest version of AlphaFold, described on 8 May in Nature1, aims to do just that — by giving scientists the ability to predict the structures of proteins during interactions with other molecules.Unlike RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold2, scientists will not be able to run their own version of AlphaFold3, nor will the code underlying AlphaFold3 or other information obtained after training the model be made public.To create AlphaFold3, Jumper, DeepMind chief executive Demis Hassabis and their colleagues made large changes to its predecessor: the latest version depends less on information about proteins related to a target sequence, for instance.An ideal tool would be able to predict structures of a protein alongside its accessories, says Jumper."},"Best ever clocks: breakthrough paves way for ultra-precise ‘nuclear’

clock keeps ultra-precise time aboard a rocking naval shipThe long-sought breakthrough — made by a collaboration between the Vienna University of Technology and Germany’s national metrology institute, the PTB, in Braunschweig — involved using an ultraviolet laser to prompt a nucleus of the radioactive metal thorium-229 to switch between energy states.And in 2003, physicists proposed using thorium-229 as the basis of a super-stable clock, but they needed to find the precise energy of the transition and its corresponding laser frequency, which would have been impossible to predict with any accuracy using theory.In principle, a nuclear clock could be even more precise than the world’s current best timekeepers, known as optical clocks, and less sensitive to disturbances.Nuclear clocks might be able to detect that wiggle, she says, because the energy of their transition is governed by these forces, and any change in their strength would alter the clock’s tick in a measurable way.Chinese team syncs clocks over record distance using lasersScientific methods that were made possible by super-precise optical clocks, such as probing Earth’s gravitational field by measuring differences in clock speed, “could get a major boost”, says Kocharovskaya."},"‘Milestone’ discovery as JWST confirms atmosphere on an Earth-like

strands of research coming together, scientists are cautiously hopeful that the immune system will indeed prove to be a key lever in healthy ageing.Credit: Eva Mejia-RamirezOne of the earliest changes in the immune system as people age is the shrinking of the thymus, which begins after puberty.How to make an old immune system young againOther scientists have used different experimental approaches to draw the same conclusion: rejuvenating the immune system rejuvenates many organs in an animal’s body, at least in mice.In March3, another team showed that restoring the balance between two key types of immune cell gives old mice more youthful immune systems, improving the animals’ ability to respond to vaccines and to stave off viral infections.“Fixing the drift in them that occurs with time seems to fix a lot of the problems of ageing — not only in the immune system but also in the rest of the body,” says Florian, who is now at the Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain."}}

first time I remember such reduced access to animal colonies since I started my Antarctic career in 1996,” says microbiologist Antonio Quesada del Corral, who manages the Spanish Antarctic research programme and is based in Madrid.Scientists have just started a new expedition to sample for bird flu on the Antarctic Peninsula, says Antonio Alcamí, a virologist based at the Severo Ochoa Centre for Molecular Biology in Madrid, who was among those who first detected H5N1 on the mainland.Research carried out under the US Antarctic Program has not yet been disrupted by bird flu, according to the National Science Foundation (NSF), which funds the programme.The virus was found in dead skuas near Argentina’s Primavera research station, located on the Antarctic Peninsula, which stretches north towards South America.Antarctic seals recruited to measure effects of climate changeResearchers first detected avian influenza, caused by the circulating H5N1 subtype of the virus, in the wider Antarctic region in October 2023."},"Inside China’s giant underground neutrino

Hyper-Kamiokande detector will use purified water as its neutrino-detecting medium, whereas the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment in the United States will rely on liquid argon to measure the elusive particles, says Mary Bishai, a physicist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York and co-spokesperson for the US observatory.If all goes to plan, the US$376 million Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) will be ready to start detecting by the end of this year, says JUNO’s on-site manager Yuekun Heng, a physicist at the Chinese Academy of Science’s Institute of High Energy Physics in Beijing.JUNO’s main goal will be to help researchers determine which type of neutrino has the highest mass and which has the least, one of the biggest mysteries in physics.JUNO sits between two nuclear power stations, each located 53 kilometres away, that will supply the detector with a steady stream of electron antineutrinos, which have the same mass as neutrinos.If levels of these elements are too high, it will be almost impossible to measure neutrinos with the sensitivity needed to solve the mass-ordering problem, says JUNO team member Alberto Garfagnini, a physicist at the University of Padua, Italy."},"First US drug approved for a liver disease surging around the

Photo LibraryFor the first time, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved a drug to treat an obesity-linked liver disease that is on the rise around the globe and is becoming a leading driver of liver failure and transplants.The drug, called resmetirom, has been shown to reduce scar tissue in the liver and other hallmarks of a disease called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH).Weight loss has been associated with a reduction in MASH severity, but an early clinical trial of semaglutide in participants with MASH yielded mixed results: some hallmarks of the disease improved, but liver fibrosis did not2.In a year-long, multinational clinical trial in 966 people with MASH, researchers found that the drug reduced inflammation and fat build-up in 30% of participants who received the highest dose of resmetirom, compared with about 10% of those who took a placebo1.MASH is often associated with the metabolic turmoil that can accompany obesity and diabetes, and in severe cases can lead to liver failure or cancer."},"Ditching ‘Anthropocene’: why ecologists say the term still

in the humanities who are using the phrase find the concept of the articulation of a particular year, based on a deposit in a particular lake, a ridiculous way of framing the concept of a human-altered planet.”Humans versus Earth: the quest to define the AnthropoceneIn a world in which the threat of climate change dominates environmental debates, the term Anthropocene can help to broaden the discussion, says Yadvinder Malhi, a biodiversity researcher at the University of Oxford, UK.After 15 years of discussion, geologists last week decided that the Anthropocene — generally understood to be the age of irreversible human impacts on the planet — will not become an official epoch in Earth’s geological timeline.Geologists reject the Anthropocene as Earth’s new epoch — after 15 years of debateThe concept of an era of human-driven change also provides convenient common ground for him to collaborate with researchers from other disciplines.“But there is a problem in not having a formal definition if people are using it in different terms, in different ways.”"},"More than 4,000 plastic chemicals are hazardous, report

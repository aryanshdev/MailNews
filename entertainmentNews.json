from Srikanth's remarkable life, the movie is much more about the life of a blind person, and the challenges that one goes through in a world where people only see them as helpless beings, who are of no use on the planet.The movie tells the story of Srikanth, who was born blind in Machilipatnam in Andhra Pradesh, into a poor farmer¬† family.While we are still not over Vidhu Vinod Chopra's 12th Fail, a new Bollywood biopic is here; Rajkummar Rao's Srikanth - the movie that tells the inspiring story of a blind man who went on to become an industrialist.But at the same time, the movie delivers the industrialist's message over the stereotypical thought process that people have for blind people, that they are not capable of anything other than begging, making candles or charity.Teacher (as Srikanth refers to her in the film) is by his side from all highs to lows; from keeping him in her home to his first court case on allowing blind students to study science, to the idea of sending him to abroad for further studies after they get bored of fighting with the system over different things due to his disability."},"Jeremy Allen White is back in the kitchen in the middle of night in The
